AB Supply chain resilience and data analytics capability have generated
   increased interest in academia and among practitioners. However,
   existing studies often treat these two streams of literature
   independently. Our study model reconciles two different streams of
   literature: data analytics capability as a means to improve
   information-processing capacity and supply chain resilience as a means
   to reduce a ripple effect in supply chain or quickly recover after
   disruptions in the supply chain. We have grounded our theoretical model
   in the organisational information processing theory (OIPT). Four
   research hypotheses are tested using responses from 213 Indian
   manufacturing organisations collected via a pre-tested survey-based
   instrument. We further test our model using variance-based structural
   equation modelling, popularly known as PLS-SEM. All of the hypotheses
   were supported. The findings of our study offer a unique contribution to
   information systems (IS) and operations management (OM) literature. The
   findings further provide numerous directions to the supply chain
   managers. Finally, we note our study limitations and provide further
   research directions.

AB For the first time, photocatalytical and antibacterial activities of
   DyBa2Fe3O7.988/DyFeO3 (Dy-Ba-Fe-O) nanocomposites as eco-friendly
   applications of this compound was studied in the same time. Since the
   applications of this compound are eco-friendly, ultrasound technique was
   chosen as the synthesis method. Achieving the pure product with good
   crystallinity with the lowest energy consumption can be considered as
   one of the advantages of this work. Using the almond core extract as a
   natural reagent was another reason for consideration this method as a
   green process. Band gap of this nanocomposite was estimated about 2.6 eV
   that showed this product can be used as a visible-active photo catalyst.
   Rhodamin-B dye as an organic pollutant model using the as-prepared nano
   composite was degraded about 72% that was a considerable result under
   visible irradiation. Elimination of microorganisms was studied by disc
   diffusion to recognize the sensitivity of bacterial (Staphylococcus
   aureus, Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, K. pneumonia and P. aeruginosa)
   strains the manufactured. The results confirmed that
   DyBa2Fe3O7.988/DyFeO3 (DBFeO) nanocomposites can be used as an
   antibacterial agent because of the manifested strong antibacterial
   ability upon Gram-negative pathogens such as K. pneumonia and E. coli.
   The properties of this product were characterized by different analyses
   including SEM, XRD, EDS, FT-IR, DRS and TEM. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy

AB Interest in nanomaterials and especially nanoparticles has exploded in
   the past decades primarily due to their novel or enhanced physical and
   chemical properties compared to bulk material. These extraordinary
   properties have created a multitude of innovative applications in the
   fields of medicine and pharma, electronics, agriculture, chemical
   catalysis, food industry, and many others. More recently, nanoparticles
   are also being synthesized 'biologically' through the use of plant- or
   microorganism-mediated processes, as an environmentally friendly
   alternative to the expensive, energy-intensive, and potentially toxic
   physical and chemical synthesis methods. This transdisciplinary approach
   to nanoparticle synthesis requires that biologists and biotechnologists
   understand and learn to use the complex methodology needed to properly
   characterize these processes. This review targets a bio-oriented
   audience and summarizes the physico-chemical properties of
   nanoparticles, and methods used for their characterization. It
   highlights why nanomaterials are different compared to micro- or bulk
   materials. We try to provide a comprehensive overview of the different
   classes of nanoparticles and their novel or enhanced physicochemical
   properties including mechanical, thermal, magnetic, electronic, optical,
   and catalytic properties. A comprehensive list of the common methods and
   techniques used for the characterization and analysis of these
   properties is presented together with a large list of examples for
   biogenic nanoparticles that have been previously synthesized and
   characterized, including their application in the fields of medicine,
   electronics, agriculture, and food production. We hope that this makes
   the many different methods more accessible to the readers, and to help
   with identifying the proper methodology for any given nanoscience
   problem.

AB Organophosphorus insecticide fenamiphos (FEN) is utilized to control the
   detrimental nematode pests. In this report, a novel molecular imprinted
   electrochemical sensor for insecticide FEN detection was prepared. The
   molecular imprinted sensor was prepared based on Co3O4 nanowire and
   core-shell Co3O4@MOF-74 nanocomposite. Firstly, hydrothermal method
   followed by thermal annealing was applied for the preparation of Co3O4
   nanowire. Then, solvothermal technique was used in no presence of metal
   salts to prepare core-shell Co3O4@MOF-74 nanocomposite. In addition,
   several solvothermal cycles were tried to optimally adjust the reaction
   efficiency. After the modification of the clean carbon electrode
   surfaces with Co3O4@MOF-74 nanocomposites, the molecular imprinted
   electrodes based on Co3O4@MOF-74 nanocomposites were prepared in
   presence of 100.0 mM pyrrole as monomer and 25.0 mM FEN as analyte
   molecule between +0.30 V and +1.50 V by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The
   prepared molecularly imprinted sensor based on Co3O4 nanowire and
   core-shell Co3O4@MOF-74 nanocomposite was characterized by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), xray
   diffraction (XRD) method, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
   fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and CV. The quantification limit (LOQ) and
   the detection limit (LOD) were obtained as 1.0 x 10(-11) M and 3.0 x
   10(-12) M, respectively, by using the developed sensor. Hence, the
   developed molecularly imprinting electrochemical sensor having high
   selectivity, stability and reproducibility was presented in this study
   for insecticide FEN detection. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Cyanazine is a beneficial herbicide in the triazines group that inhibits
   photosynthesis in plants and monitoring of this herbicide is so
   important for study agriculture products. The present researches have
   been focused on monitoring of cyanazine by a straightforward and fast
   electrochemical strategy. Herein, to monitor the cyanazine level, Pt and
   Pd doped CdO nanoparticle decorated SWCNTs composite (Pt-Pd-CdO/SWCNTs)
   has been synthesized as a conductive mediator and characterized by EDS,
   SEM and TEM techniques. The Pt-Pd-CdO/SWCNTs and ds-DNA have been used
   for modification of the gold electrode (GE). Moreover, the oxidation
   signal of guanine relative to ds-DNA at the surface of
   Pt-Pd-CdO/SWCNTs/ds-DNA/GE has been considered as an
   bioelectroanalytical issue to monitoring cyanazine for the first time.
   Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) signals have confirmed
   that the inclusion of Pt-Pd-CdO/SWCNTs at the surface of the GE has
   lowered chargetransfer resistance by ca.1.54 times and created a highly
   conductive state for monitoring of cyanazine in nanomolar concentration.
   On the other hand, differential pulse voltammograms (DPV) of
   Pt-Pd-CdO/SWCNTs/ ds-DNA/GE have indicated a linear dynamic range of 4.0
   nM-70 mu M with a detection limit of 0.8 nM to the monitoring of
   cyanazine. In addition, the molecular docking study has emphasized that
   cyanazine herbicide is capable of binding to ds-DNA preferably at the
   guanine-cytosine rich sequences, and confirmed experimental results. In
   the final step, Pt-Pd-CdO/SWCNTs/ds-DNA/GE has been successfully
   utilized for the monitoring of cyanazine herbicide in food and water
   samples.

AB As a crucial branch for titanium industry, high-strength titanium alloys
   (HS-TAs, with UTS > 1100 MPa) are indispensable structural materials for
   advanced engineering applications such as aerospace and marine fields.
   Along with the expansion of HS-TAs' market, achieving satisfying
   synergies of high strength, high ductility (elongation > 6%) and high
   toughness (KIC > 50 MPa.m(1/2)) has been identified as the uppermost
   technical bottleneck for their research and development. To overcome the
   challenge, two primary strategies have been initiated by the titanium
   community, developing novel alloys and innovating processing
   technologies. For the former, a dozen of newly-developed alloys were
   reported to exhibit excellent strength-ductility-toughness combinations,
   including Ti-5553, BT22, TC21 and Ti-1300, for which the ideal
   mechanical performances were based on specific microstructures realized
   by low impurity rate (e.g. oxygen content < 0.15 wt%), complicated
   processing and complex heat treatment. For the latter, several
   innovatory forging and heat treatment technologies were originated for
   the mature alloys to optimize their balanced property by extraordinary
   microstructural characteristics. In this review, we provide a
   comprehensive overview over the research status, processing and heat
   treatment technologies, phase transformation,
   processing-microstructure-property correlation and
   strengthening-toughening mechanism of HS-TAs for aerospace engineering
   applications manufactured via melting-forging process. Finally, the
   prospects and recommendations for further investigation and development
   are proposed based on this review.

AB Customers increasingly orchestrate their everyday activities with the
   support of technology, with services in-creasingly adopting AI-based
   applications. Yet, research is still in its infancy and has been largely
   conceptual. Therefore, based on data collected from 238 young consumers,
   analyzed using PLS-SEM, this study focuses on users' motivations to
   adopt intelligent digital voice assistants in service encounters.
   Findings show that functional, social and relational elements drive
   adoption, untangle crossover effects between them and reveal the
   moderating role of experience and need for human interaction. While
   empirically validating and extending the Service Robot Acceptance Model
   by Wirtz and colleagues, this study provides evidence that
   anthropomorphism is not universally positive and adds a new perspective
   regarding the underexplored role of customer-robot rapport building. The
   study contributes to a more holistic understanding of digital voice
   assistants' adoption and provides managerial guidance on how to
   successfully implement such technologies.

AB To develop new up-conversion luminescent materials for optical
   thermometry, a sequence of Ca2MgWO6:xEr3+, yYb3+ phosphor samples were
   synthesized via high temperature solid-state reaction method. Their
   structure, morphology and luminescent performances were completely
   explored via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and
   photoluminescence. Excited by 980 nm laser, all phosphor samples emit
   intense up-conversion luminescence of Er3+ at 531, 549 and 661 nm.
   Besides, these emissions were greatly enhanced with addition of Yb3+
   ions. Benefiting from the different temperature dependence of three
   emission peaks, a dual-mode temperature sensor based on fluorescence
   intensity ratio (2H11/2/4S3/2 and 2H11/2/4F9/2) is realized by using
   single luminescent center. Meanwhile, the fluorescence lifetime of 4S3/2
   state of Er3+ ions was used as the third temperature detection signal.
   More importantly, the phosphors exhibit superior thermal stability that
   will be helpful to obtain high precision temperature measurement. All
   results show that Ca2MgWO6:Er3+, Yb3+ samples could have potential
   applications for self-referenced optical thermometry.

AB Tetracycline (TC) adsorption capacity on pristine biochar was limited.
   Biochar modification can greatly improve its adsorption amount. In this
   study, rice straw was mixed with FeCl3 center dot 6H(2)O and urea to
   prepare a Fe-N modified biochar via a one-pot pyrolysis method at 700
   degrees C. Meanwhile, pristine biochar (RSBC), urea modified biochar
   (N-RSBC), FeCl3 center dot 6H(2)O-modified biochar (Fe-RSBC) were
   produced as control. More functional groups, more graphited carbon
   structure, and magnetic components were observed in Fe-N-RSBC. Compared
   with RSBC, the surface area, total pore and micropore volume of
   Fe-N-RSBC increased 3.4-fold, 3.0-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively. The
   maximum capacity of TC adsorption on Fe-N-RSBC reached 156 mg.g(-1),
   which was 5.4 - fold, 8.2 - fold and 1.9 - fold increase to that of
   RSBC, N-RSBC, Fe-RSBC, respectively. The mechanism of TC adsorption on
   Fe-N-RSBC involved pore filling, hydrogen-bond interaction, surface
   complexation, and pi-pi interaction. Therefore, Fe-N-RSBC can be used as
   an effective adsorbent for TC removal from aqueous solution.

AB Despite concerns about the ecotoxicological effects of microplastics in
   soils, there is a limited understanding of the reproductive toxicity of
   microplastics to soil organisms and the production of nanoplastics
   through biological fragmentation. We used the earthworm Eisenia andrei
   to investigate the generation of nanoplastics from polyethylene
   microplastics in soil ecosystems and to determine the negative effects
   of microplastic exposure on soil invertebrates. Earthworms were exposed
   to two different sizes of microplastic for 21 days, and various
   physiological features, including those pertaining to reproduction, were
   subsequently analyzed. Exposure to micro plastics affected coelomocyte
   viability and caused damage to male reproductive organs, while having
   negligible effects on female reproductive organs. Earthworm-induced
   fragmentation of microplastics to nanoplastics was confirmed using
   scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. These
   nanoplastics were introduced into soils through cast excretion. We
   provide the evidence of nanoplastic generation from ingested
   microplastics and damage caused to earthworm spermatogenesis through
   microplastic exposure.

AB Discovering the motivations behind the adoption of green production
   practices and its impact on firm performance from the perspective of
   Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) have become crucial for both
   scholars and practitioners. However, there exists a substantial
   unexplored research gap regarding how stakeholder pressures motivate and
   influence the adoption of green production practices and the performance
   of SMEs in the context of developing countries. Drawing on the
   institutional theory, stakeholder theory and the natural resource-based
   view, this study explores the framework through which organizational and
   regulatory stakeholder pressures influence the adoption of green
   production practices, firm reputation, environmental and financial
   performance. The study employed a quantitative approach and partial
   least square structural equation modelling technique in making data
   analysis and interpretations due to its appropriateness for predictive
   research models. Using a survey research design, data were collected
   from owners and managers of manufacturing SMEs. The findings revealed
   that whiles regulatory stakeholder pressures positively and
   significantly influenced the adoption of green production practices,
   firm reputation, financial and environmental performance, organizational
   stakeholder pressures positively and significantly influenced the
   adoption of green production practices, firm reputation, and
   environmental performance. Green production practices also proved
   significant and positive in influencing firm reputation and
   environmental performance. The findings particularly exposed that
   organizational stakeholder pressures and green production practices had
   a negative yet significant influence on financial performance. The study
   highlights the significance of stakeholder pressures in making green
   production initiatives mandatory for organizational growth while also
   guiding policymakers, managers and scholars. (C) 2020 Institution of

AB Activated carbons and MOF-based composite were prepared from the
   ashitaba biomass and they were applied and compared in the adsorption of
   methylene blue from aqueous solution. Surface chemistry of these
   adsorbents was characterized with different analytical techniques and
   results were used to analyze the corresponding adsorption interactions.
   Statistical physics calculations were performed to interpret the
   physicochemical parameters involved in the dye adsorption mechanism.
   Results showed that the dye adsorption with activated carbons was
   endothermic, while an exothermic dye removal was observed with the
   MOF-activated carbon composite. Dye adsorption mechanism was a
   multimolecular process mainly for ashitaba-based activated carbons where
   electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding
   were present. In particular, the activated carbon functionalized with a
   surfactant outperformed other adsorbents prepared with the ashitaba
   biomass thus showing adsorption capacities higher than 400 mg/g. This
   adsorbent is promising for its application in the treatment of
   wastewaters polluted by this and other dye molecules.

AB In this study, both CuO nanoparticles and ZnO nanorods were anchored on
   thermally-exfoliated g-C3N4 nano sheets (denoted as CZ@T-GCN) via
   isoelectric point-mediated annealing process as a novel
   nano-photocatalyst towards degradation of amoxicillin (AMOX). The
   features of prepared materials were characterized using BET, UV-vis DRS,
   XRD, FT-IR, XPS, FE-SEM, TEM, EIS and transient photocurrent techniques.
   These analyses demonstrated the successful formation of heterojunctions
   between components of CZ@T-GCN nanocomposite, which reflected in
   significantly increased electron-hole separation and enhanced
   degradation of AMOX as compared with pure substances. The investigation
   of influential operative parameters confirmed that the complete removal
   of AMOX could be attained under catalytic dosage of 0.9 g L-1 and pH of
   7.0 within 120 min simulated sunlight illumination. Generation of OH
   center dot upon illumination of catalysts was verified by terephthalic
   acid photoluminescence (TPA-PL) spectroscopy. Also, trapping tests
   proved that OH center dot and O-2(center dot-) were the major reactive
   radicals in AMOX decontamination. A novel double Z-scheme mechanism as
   well as a tentative pathway for fractionation of AMOX by CZ@T-GCN
   photocatalytic system were proposed in details. Only a marginal decrease
   in photocatalytic activity occurred after 5 consecutive tests. In an
   attempt to study the industrial applicability of catalyst, more than 79
   % COD and 63 % TOC were eliminated under optimum conditions during 120
   min illumination and the biodegradability of treated wastewater was also
   improved.

AB Developing countries like South Africa is aiming to be a nation that has
   fully harnessed the potential of Industry 4.0 technological innovation
   to grow the economy and uplift people of the country. The country has
   motivated manufactures to focus on smart manufacturing considering the
   sustainable development aspects to develop circular economy
   capabilities. However, manufacturers are facing various resource related
   challenges, which has slowed down the progress of Industry 4.0 adoption.
   This study aspires to develop a theoretical model linking key resources
   for Industry 4.0 adoption that are essential to drive technological
   progress; and its effect on sustainable production and circular economy
   capabilities. The review of literature led to the identification of
   thirty-five resources that are essential for the adoption of Industry
   4.0. Further, exploratory factor analysis was used to group the
   variables under relevant factors and thereafter research team developed
   a theoretical model that was further tested using PLS-SEM technique.
   Research findings indicate that production systems, human resources,
   project management, management leadership, green logistics, green
   design, information technology, big data analytics and collaborative
   relationships are key resources for Industry 4.0 adoption; second,
   Industry 4.0 adoption have a positive relationship with sustainable
   production and finally, sustainable production has a positive
   relationship with circular economy capabilities. The study concludes
   with theoretical and practical implications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The perovskite solar cell has emerged rapidly in the field of
   photovoltaics as it combines the merits of low cost, high efficiency,
   and excellent mechanical flexibility for versatile applications.
   However, there are significant concerns regarding its operational
   stability and mechanical robustness. Most of the previously reported
   approaches to address these concerns entail separate engineering of
   perovskite and charge-transporting layers. Herein we present a holistic
   design of perovskite and charge-transporting layers by synthesizing an
   interpenetrating perovskite/electron-transporting-layer interface. This
   interface is reaction-formed between a tin dioxide layer containing
   excess organic halide and a perovskite layer containing excess lead
   halide. Perovskite solar cells with such interfaces deliver efficiencies
   up to 22.2% and 20.1% for rigid and flexible versions, respectively.
   Long-term (1000h) operational stability is demonstrated and the flexible
   devices show high endurance against mechanical-bending (2500 cycles)
   fatigue. Mechanistic insights into the relationship between the
   interpenetrating interface structure and performance enhancement are
   provided based on comprehensive, advanced, microscopic
   characterizations. This study highlights interface integrity as an
   important factor for designing efficient, operationally-stable, and
   mechanically-robust solar cells. Operational stability and mechanical
   robustness remain as engineering bottlenecks in perovskite solar cells
   technology. Here, Dong et al. introduce an interpenetrating perovskite
   at the electron-transporting-layer interface that enables a 1000-hour
   stable operation and high endurance against bending fatigue over 2500
   cycles.

AB A facile agar-gel method was successfully applied to prepare a series of
   homogenous Mn-Co mixed oxides with different Mn/Co molar ratios for
   highly efficient catalysis of total toluene oxidation. The obtained
   Mn2Co1 mixed oxide exhibited a high catalytic activity with excellent
   durability as well as high tolerability even under 20 vol.% water vapor
   environment. Characterizations by XRF, XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption,
   SEM, TEM, H-2-TPR, O-2-TPD, XPS measurements with density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the obtained optimum Mn-Co
   mixed oxide had high specific surface area, large amounts of Co3+, Mn3+,
   and Mn4+ species, abundant adsorbed oxygen species, rich lattice
   defects, high reducibility at low temperature, and excellent O-2
   adsorption ability. Meanwhile, in situ DRIFTS spectra measurements
   confirmed the generated intermediates at different environments during
   the toluene oxidation and revealed that both adsorbed oxygen and lattice
   oxygen species could simultaneously participate in the toluene
   adsorption-oxidation process, especially the rate-controlling step
   should be the C=C breakage of aromatic ring. It is expected that the
   present agar-gel method with low cost and convenient operation could be
   widely applied for the designing of novel mixed metal oxides catalysts
   for VOCs oxidation.

   systematically analyzed by various methods (e.g., XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS,

   of core-shell structured BTO/CdS composites. Photocurrent response and
   EIS analyses demonstrate that enhanced separation of photogenerated
   electron-hole pairs is realized in the BTO/CdS heterojunctions.
   Simulated-sunlight driving photodegradation of methylene blue (MB)
   reveals that the optimal composite sample 20%BTO/CdS is endowed with a
   photocatalytic activity about 1.6 and 3.3 times higher than that of bare
   CdS and BTO, respectively. Moreover, the 20%BTO/CdS heterojunction

AB Fused deposition modeling (FDM) has unique advantages in the rapid
   prototyping of thermoplastics which have been developed in diverse
   fields. However, although great efforts have been made to optimize FDM
   process, the mechanical properties of printed parts are limited by the
   weak interlamination bonding as well as the poor performance of raw
   filaments used, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS),
   polylactic acid (PLA). Adding fibers into thermoplastic matrix and
   preparing high-performance filaments have been indicated to enhance the
   properties of fabricated parts. Recently, heat-resistant
   polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and its fiber reinforced composites were
   proposed for FDM process due to overcoming the limitation of equipment
   and process. However, few researches have been reported on the effects
   of FDM-3D printing parameters on the mechanical properties of fiber
   reinforced PEEK composites. Therefore, 5wt% carbon fiber (CF) and glass
   fiber (GF) reinforced PEEK composite filaments were prepared
   respectively in this study. The effects of various printing parameters
   including nozzle temperature, platform temperature, printing speed and
   layer thickness on the mechanical properties (including tensile
   strength, flexural strength and impact strength) were surveyed. To
   analyze the microstructure and failure reasons of printed CF/PEEK and
   GF/PEEK samples, the tensile fractured surfaces were investigated via
   scanning electron microscope (SEM). (c) 2020 Chinese Society of

AB Activated carbon (ENAC) was prepared by NaOH activation, using
   macroalgae (Enteromorpha clathrate) as raw material. The prepared
   activated carbon has a large surface area (1238.491 m(2) g(-1)) and its
   total pore volume and average pore size are 0.6823 cm(3) g(-1) and
   2.2038 nm, respectively. The ENAC was characterized by SEM, FTIR, BET
   and XPS. The effects of contact time (0-960 min), initial tetracycline
   (TC) concentration (50-500 mg L-1), temperature (30-50 degrees C) and
   initial pH (2-11) on TC adsorption were evaluated. The adsorption
   isotherm and adsorption kinetics were discussed. Results showed that the
   adsorption isotherm was the Langmuir model, and the adsorption process
   can be described by the pseudo-second-order model. The N-2
   adsorption-desorption isotherm was type IV, indicating that the
   activated carbon had mesoporous structure. Thermodynamic analysis showed
   that the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. The maximum
   adsorption capacity of TC was 381.584 mg g(-1). Density functional
   theory (DFT) was used to simulate and analyze the adsorption process,
   and the influence of different types of N on the adsorption was
   expounded. The results showed that there are electrostatic interactions,
   pi-pi interactions and hydrogen bonding between the adsorbent and TC.

AB This research work primarily focussed on the production of biochar from
   sugarcane bagasse through HTC followed by NaOH activation at inert
   atmosphere for removing SMX from water. The biochar was characterized
   for structural morphology and presence of functional groups. XRD and
   FTIR analysis confirmed that presence of aromatized graphitic structure
   accumulated with oxygenated functional groups are responsible for the
   elimination of SMX. SEM analysis portrayed the sphere-shaped structure
   of biochar with hydrophobic groups interior and hydrophilic groups
   exterior. BET isotherm revealed the active surface area equal to 1099
   m(2)/g with high coverage of mesopores structure. P-zpc of adsorbent is
   evaluated to 6.5 stating that effective removal of SMX depends on
   ionization effects induced due to reaction medium. Kinetics study
   revealed the sorption of SMX followed chemical interaction pertaining to
   Elovich model. Isotherm studies revealed that Freundlich model fitted
   well stating heterogeneous mode of interaction. Immobilization of SMX on
   surface of ABC is due to charge assisted hydrogen bonding and pi-pi
   interaction with graphitized carbon, showing maximum sorption capacity
   of 400 mg/g through spontaneous reaction. The results suggested that HTC
   derived biochar had great adsorption affinity with respect to pH towards
   SMX and could be employed as an effective sorbent in cleaning water
   contaminants.

AB Confining active species and intermediates in a limited spatial is
   critical to driving pollutant transformation involving successive
   reactions for boosting degradation. Herein, core?shell g-C3N4@ZIF-8 were
   prepared by exfoliating-wrapping of g-C3N4 via ZIF-8 in-situ growth.
   XRD, SEM, TEM, and EDX mapping demonstrate the inclusion of curled
   g-C3N4 sheets in ZIF-8. UV?vis, PL, FTIR, and XPS confirm the
   coordination of TC with Zn of ZIF-8. Steady-transient PL, EIS and
   transient photocurrent response indicate that the combination of two
   materials favors the carriers? separation and transfer. Further band
   analysis suggests that interfacial band bending of g-C3N4 promotes the
   separation of electron-hole and electron diffusion toward ZIF-8. As
   result, the optimized gC3N4@ZIF-8 exhibits a superior TC degradation
   rate constant (k = 0.068 min-1), 4.8 times higher than that of gC3N4 (k
   = 0.014 min-1), and enhanced TC removal rate of 87.6% higher than g-C3N4
   (58.6%). Also, the optimized material shows superior degradation rate
   and removal efficacy in RhB (99.3%) and Cr (VI) (96.6%) in surface
   water. The investigations on active species and degradation routes (EPR,
   LC-MS) reveal that synergetic effects of ZIF-8 confined g-C3N4
   facilitate the formation of oxygen radicals (?O2- ) and their
   transformation toward singlet oxygen (1O2) for boosting TC degradation.

AB Sediments have been found to be one of the most important reservoirs for
   microplastics, providing abundant indigenous microbes. The processes
   involved in the distribution and degradation behavior of microplastics
   are complex. This study investigated the vertical distribution of
   microplastics (with the size < 5 mm) and the bacterial community
   assemblages colonizing microplastics in urban river sediments at a depth
   from 0 to 50 cm. The results showed that both microplastics and
   associated microbial communities presented vertical profiles in river
   sediments. The mean concentration of microplastics increased from the
   shallow layers to the deep layers of sediments, and smaller microplastic
   particles were dominant in deeper layers. A greater degradation of
   microplastics in deeper layers was confirmed by contact angle
   measurements, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance analyses. Unlike the
   surrounding sediments, the whole bacterial communities on microplastics
   exhibited higher frequency of positive correlations in the bacterial
   co-occurrence network, which indicated a less stability of bacterial
   communities on microplastics. The indicative plastic-degrading bacteria
   with an average abundance of 4.33% was found in the surrounding
   sediments, while on the microplastics 21.37% was found. From shallow
   layers to deep layers, the indicative plastic-degrading bacteria
   significantly increased both in the abundance and in their betweenness
   centrality in the co-occurrence network, which suggested a potentially
   primary role of these bacteria in the degradation of microplastics in
   deep layers. This study provides new insight into the vertical
   distribution and the potential microbial degrading characteristics of
   microplastics in urban river sediments, which expanded our understanding
   of the fate of microplastics in aquatic environments. The observed
   results implied a great risk that microplastics might become smaller and
   more in deepened sediments and finally migrate into groundwater. (C)

AB Supply chain resilience (SCRes) and performance have become increasingly
   important in the wake of the recent supply chain disruptions caused by
   subsequent pandemics and crisis. Besides, the context of digitalization,
   integration, and globalization of the supply chain has raised an
   increasing awareness of advanced information processing techniques such
   as Artificial Intelligence (AI) in building SCRes and improving supply
   chain performance (SCP). The present study investigates the direct and
   indirect effects of AI, SCRes, and SCP under a context of dynamism and
   uncertainty of the supply chain. In doing so, we have conceptualized the
   use of AI in the supply chain on the organizational information
   processing theory (OIPT). The developed framework was evaluated using a
   structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Survey data was collected
   from 279 firms representing different sizes, operating in various
   sectors, and countries. Our findings suggest that while AI has a direct
   impact on SCP in the short-term, it is recommended to exploit its
   information processing capabilities to build SCRes for long-lasting SCP.
   This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence on
   maximizing the benefits of AI capabilities to generate sustained SCP.
   The study could be further extended using a longitudinal investigation
   to explore more facets of the phenomenon.

AB The use of conventional chemical coagulants and flocculants to treat
   pollutant-laden effluents generates residues with harmful effects on the
   environment. This has led us to think through this study of their
   replacement by more ecological natural products. The present work
   focuses on the use of a bentonite-based coagulant and a cactus-based
   flocculant (Opuntia ficus indica (OFIP)) in the elimination of a
   methylene blue (MB), a basic textile dye. The biomaterials are
   characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM and pH(PZC). To estimate the performance
   of the biomaterials in the coagulation-flocculation process, jar-test
   work was performed on the MB dye in aqueous solution. The monitoring of
   the variation of MB removal rates was performed by UV-visible
   spectroscopy. The effect of biomaterial masses, stirring time and speed
   and settling time on the dye removal process were studied. In addition,
   the effects of pH and initial MB concentration were also studied. The
   results show that a mass of 0.9 g of bentonite and 0.4 g of OFIP are the
   optimal quantities, giving a dye removal rate of 98.29 % during 19 min,
   at a stirring speed of 180 rpm and 40 rpm for coagulation and
   flocculation, respectively. These optimum values are obtained with a
   settling time of 15 min. However, pH does not have a significant
   influence on the MB removal rates. These biomaterials gave excellent
   results with 98.99 % dye removal rates at an initial MB concentration of
   90 mg/L. In addition, for the purpose of testing the performance of the
   biomaterials, a comparative study using conventional chemicals was
   performed.

AB Pure Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) and gold (Au) decorated
   (Au-ZnO) hetero-nanostructures were synthesized using green-synthesis
   method employing pecan nuts (Carya illinoinensis) leaves extract as
   reducing agent. The structural and optical properties studied by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (EDX), High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and
   UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-vis). Structural modification with the
   introduction of Au in ZnO have been confirmed by the XRD and TEM
   results. UV data confirmed the decrease in Au-ZnO energy band-gap E-g
   value, which validates the formation of hetero-structure. The modulation
   of energy band-gap causes visible light absorption and hence enhances
   the photodegradation activity of Au-ZnO. Photocatalytic activity was
   carried-out by degradation of RhB dye under UV light irradiation in
   aqueous solution. The maximum degradation of 95 % was obtained during
   the time of 180 min for the basic pH of the dye. The Enhanced
   degradation in Au-ZnO as compared with bare ZnO NPs, was attributed to
   Au, which controls the amount of electron and suppress electron-hole
   ratio at ZnO surface. In the recycling study of the Au-ZnO
   Photocatalyst, the hetero-structure showed good stability up to five
   cycles.

AB Exploiting multi-scale representations is critical to improve edge
   detection for objects at different scales. To extract edges at
   dramatically different scales, we propose a bi-directional cascade
   network (BDCN) architecture, where an individual layer is supervised by
   labeled edges at its specific scale, rather than directly applying the
   same supervision to different layers. Furthermore, to enrich multi-scale
   representations learned by each layer of BDCN, we introduce a scale
   enhancement module (SEM), which utilizes dilated convolution to generate
   multi-scale features, instead of using deeper CNNs. These new approaches
   encourage the learning of multi-scale representations in different
   layers and detect edges that are well delineated by their scales.
   Learning scale dedicated layers also results in a compact network with a
   fraction of parameters. We evaluate our method on three datasets, i.e.,
   BSDS500, NYUDv2, and Multicue, and achieve ODS F-measure of 0.832, 2.7
   percent higher than current state-of-the-art on the BSDS500 dataset. We
   also applied our edge detection result to other vision tasks.
   Experimental results show that, our method further boosts the
   performance of image segmentation, optical flow estimation, and object
   proposal generation.

AB This study examines the role of green human resource management
   practices towards the environmental performance of green hotels in
   Malaysia. It also investigates the mediating effect of green
   intellectual capital and pro-environmental behavior. The target
   population consisted of employees of green hotels in Malaysia. Data
   collected using a survey questionnaire from 374 employees was subjected
   to PLS-SEM for analysis. The findings revealed that green human resource
   practices (Green training & development and green discipline management)
   are significant predictors for green intellectual capital further
   positively contribution towards pro-environmental behavior. Findings
   also proved that employees' pro-environmental behavior plays a
   significant role to enhance the environmental performance of hotels.
   Moreover, it is shown that green human resource management practices
   indirectly contribute to environmental performance through green
   intellectual capital and proenvironmental behaviors. This study is one
   of the few attempts to integrate the green human resource management
   practices with green intellectual capital and pro-environmental
   behaviors in the domain of environment management. It explicitly
   contributes towards a new line of research to understand the crucial
   role of green human resource management practices to improve the
   environmental performance of hotels. The study findings have postulated
   green training and development as a key practice to build intellectual
   capital and foster proenvironmental behaviors. It can help the managers
   in their effort to build the intellectual capital that facilitates to
   generate pro-environmental behaviors. In order to cope with the rising
   environmental concerns of the hotel industry, the present study suggests
   that managers should maintain green discipline by punishing or fining
   employees for not observing the environmental policy of hotels.

AB The removal of organic dyes from wastewater by innovative effluent
   treatment plant, which can truly clean the wastewater without leaving
   any fragments of dye species without generating secondary waste, is one
   of the prime challenges to the present world. The natural polymers were
   wheat flour, turmeric powder, pure starch, starch nanoparticles and some
   other forms of rice or wheat grains, while the synthetic polymeric
   adsorbents were polyaniline (PAni) and PAni/starch composites
   systematically studied for dyes adsorption. The cationic dye, methylene
   blue (MB), and an anionic dye, orange green (OG), from aqueous solutions
   through the adsorption using ten adsorbents of three categories; natural
   and synthetic polymers, and their composites, were widely investigated.
   The adsorbents either prepared or pre-treated were characterized using
   Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and differential
   thermal analyses techniques. The formation of PAni/starch composites was
   confirmed by the results of FTIR and thermal analyses. The SEM and XRD
   measurements were employed to determine the surface morphology and
   particle/crystallite size of the adsorbents. The degrees of adsorption
   of MB and OG on all adsorbents studied were evaluated by UV-visible
   spectroscopic technique. The cost effectiveness of the adsorbents
   studied was evaluated where the starch-based adsorbents are explored to
   be promising from economic and environmental viewpoints. The mechanism
   of adsorption of MB and OG dyes on starch-based adsorbents was also
   discussed.

   process. The Co-Al LDH was derived from a Co-metal organic framework.
   FE-SEM, TEM, FTIR, XPS, and BET characterizations and Cr(VI) and Pb(II)
   adsorption capacities of the composites were investigated in detail. The
   super hydrophilic Co-Al-LDH@Fe2O3/3DPCNF exhibited superfast removal
   efficiencies for Cr(VI) and Pb(II) with maximum adsorption capacities of
   400.40 mg g(-1) and 426.76 mg g(-1), respectively. Precipitation,
   surface complexation, isomorphic substitution, and electron transfer
   were considered to be the main adsorption mechanisms. Adsorption
   isotherms were well fitted using the Sips model, and the adsorption
   thermodynamics demonstrated that the adsorption process is endothermic
   and spontaneous. The Co-Al-LDH@Fe2O3/3DPCNF maintained excellent
   adsorption capacity after ten cycles. The present study provides a new
   pathway to significantly improve the adsorption performance and
   stability of LDHs with easy separation from water body.

AB Using protection motivation theory (PMT), this study investigates the
   influence of cognitive assessment and affective response on customers'
   behavioral intention amid COVID-19 in the context of restaurants. More
   specifically, this research draws attention to (1) the influence of
   protection motivation (i.e., perceived vulnerability, perceived
   severity, maladaptive reward, response efficacy, self-efficacy, response
   cost) on hope and fear, (2) hope and fear as mediators between
   protection motivation and behavioral intention, and (3) diverse customer
   behavioral intentions that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic
   (i.e., health-focused behavior, conscious consumption, and the
   supporting of local businesses and products). A total of 473 completed
   responses were obtained through an online survey. Structural equation
   modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothesized relationships. The
   research model proposed in the study successfully explained the process
   in which individuals commit to hygienic behaviors, prioritize local
   restaurants, and engage in conscious consumption under the threat of
   COVID-19. The proposed model can be utilized in examining consumer
   behaviors in the hospitality industry, especially in the COVID-19 era.

AB With the advent of 5G era, the electronic and electrical industries are
   in increasingly urgent demand for flexible materials with high thermal
   conductivity coefficients (lambda). In this paper, alumina (Al2O3) was
   chemically grafted to the surface of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) to
   prepare hetero-structured thermally conductive fillers (BNNS@Al2O3), and
   two-component room temperature vulcanized silicone rubber (RTV-2SR) was
   used as the polymer matrix. Then BNNS@Al2O3/RTV-2SR flexible thermally
   conductive and electrically insulating composite films were prepared by
   shear-coating. Results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric
   analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the
   BNNS@Al2O3 hetero-structured thermally conductive fillers with
   "point-plane" structure were successfully prepared. The BNNS@Al2O3
   hetero-structured thermally conductive fillers successfully achieved the
   synergy of Al2O3 and BNNS and had more significant improvement on lambda
   than single Al2O3, single BNNS, and simply blending BNNS/Al2O3. When the
   amount of BNNS@Al2O3 was 30 wt% (BNNS/Al2O3, 1:1, wt:wt), the in-plane
   lambda (lambda(parallel to)) and through-plane lambda
   (lambda(perpendicular to)) of the BNNS@Al2O3/RTV-2SR thermally
   conductive composite film reached 2.86 W/mK and 0.89 W/mK, 2.8 times
   lambda(parallel to) (1.01 W/mK) and 4.2 times lambda(perpendicular to)
   (0.21 W/mK) pure RTV-2SR film, also higher than those of BNNS/RTV-2SR
   (with single BNNS, lambda(parallel to) = 2.46 W/mK, lambda(perpendicular
   to) = 0.76 W/mK), Al2O3/RTV-2SR (with single Al2O3, lambda(parallel to)
   = 1.62 W/mK, lambda(perpendicular to) = 0.49 W/mK), and
   (BNNS/Al2O3)/RTV-2SR (with simply blending BNNS/Al2O3, 1:1, wt:wt,
   lambda(parallel to) = 2.04 W/mK, lambda(perpendicular to) = 0.62 W/mK)
   thermally conductive composite films with the same fillers amount.
   Meanwhile, the prepared BNNS@Al2O3/RTV-2SR thermally conductive
   composite film obtained excellent mechanical properties, electrical
   insulation properties, and thermal properties. Its tensile strength,
   elongation at break, hardness, dielectric constant (epsilon), dielectric
   loss (tan delta), volume resistivity (rho(v)), glass transition
   temperature (T-g), and heat resistance index temperature (T-HRI),
   respectively, reached 0.84 MPa, 175%, 27 HA, 3.89, 0.0088, 5.76 x 10(11)
   omega center dot cm, - 40.1 degrees C and 185.3 degrees C. This work can
   provide a new idea for the preparation of hetero-structured thermally

AB With the changing way people live, communicate, and work, enterprises
   are striving to shift their existing business model into a "self-tuning"
   one. Enterprises are becoming more agile, adaptive, and ambidextrous in
   order to boost innovation in the current digital transformation era.
   Nowadays, "digital innovation" is closely associated with Industry 4.0
   enablers and smart enterprises. Prior research has shown that while
   multinational enterprises-across many sectors-have already embraced the
   aforementioned advancements, their adoption by small and-medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs) has so far taken place mainly in the manufacturing
   sector. Thus, based on a sample of 280 self-tuned smart manufacturing
   SMEs and having utilized the structural equation modeling (SEM), this
   study was aimed to investigate how digital innovation is influenced by
   the three pillars of self-tuning models-agility, adaptation, and
   ambidexterity. Our paper has focussed on the digital systems in which
   SMEs, spurred by networking and open innovation solutions, operate and
   innovate in response to external triggers, displaying a balance between
   exploration and exploitation, and a strong agile capacity.

AB Nanomaterials possess outstanding physical, chemical, and electrical
   properties that differentiate them from conventional materials.
   Recently, nano-modified alkali-activated composites (AACs) or
   geopolymers have attracted attention owing to their excellent
   performance and modification mechanisms. This review paper en-capsulates
   nano-modified AACs' fresh, mechanical, and microstructural properties.
   Nano-SiO2 was the most frequently used nanomaterial, accounting for 44%
   of the studies conducted. Regarding the types of composites, 55%, 29%,
   and 16% of the studies were focused on paste, mortar, and concrete,
   respectively. Most studies have shown that increasing the nanomaterials
   content in an alkaline medium reduced AACs consistency and setting time
   due to the small particle size, high specific surface area, unsaturated
   bonds, and high reactivity of nano -materials. The results mostly
   indicated that while increasing nano-additives proportion to a certain
   extent im-proves the mechanical characteristics, including compressive,
   flexural, tensile, and impact strengths, incorporation beyond that
   amount deteriorates them. In terms of microstructure: porosity or
   homogeneity, amorphicity or crystallinity, and chemical bond variations
   have been investigated through analytical tests (SEM, XRD, and FTIR).
   The majority of performed studies acknowledged that incorporating
   nanomaterials brings about a denser, homogenous structure with more
   stable chemical bonds and a higher degree of amorphicity. This study has
   shown that provided that the precursor type and ultimate applicability
   of purposed building material were considered during the selection of
   type, amount, and mixing method of nanomaterials, their incorporation in
   AACs could have incredible effects on mechanical and microstructural
   properties of them and will facilitate fostering sustainable
   construction materials.

AB A novel red phosphor LaSc3(BO3)(4):Eu3+ with high quantum efficiency and
   zero-thermal-quenching was reported. The crystal structure and
   electronic structure were investigated by Rietveld refinement method and
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The FE-SEM and TEM
   analysis were performed to further understand the phase evolution of
   LaSc3(BO3)(4):Eu3+. The energy migration among Eu3+ ions was strongly
   suppressed due to the long distance of nearest-neighbor Eu3+ sites. The
   phosphor exhibited high doping concentration of 80 mol%, high quantum
   efficiency of 88.3% and zero-thermal-quenching until 275 degrees C.
   Further researches show that the zero-thermal-quenching behavior is
   consistent with the thermal disturbance model. Finally, A warm white
   light LED device with a low correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3438 K
   and high color rendering index (CRI) of 92.5 was fabricated based on the
   as-prepared red phosphor LaSc3(BO3)(4):Eu3+, indicating that
   LaSc3(BO3)(4):Eu(3+)phosphor is promising for high-power LEDs. These
   findings may open up new ways for the exploration of high-performance
   Eu3+-activated phosphors.

AB This paper investigates a technique for broadband vibration suppression
   using a graded metamaterial beam. A series of local resonators with the
   same mass but different natural frequencies are attached to the beam.
   The difference between the natural frequencies of neighboring local
   resonators is defined as the frequency spacing. The spectral element
   method (SEM) is used to model the graded metamaterial beam, and is
   verified by the corresponding finite element model (FEM). Three figures
   of merit are defined to quantitatively evaluate the vibration
   suppression performance of the proposed metamaterial beam, in terms of
   the attenuation bandwidth and attenuation strength. Subsequently, a
   design strategy is proposed, and used to tune the frequency spacing to
   get a wide attenuation region. A parametric study is conducted to reveal
   the effects of the frequency spacing and damping ratio on the vibration
   suppression performance of the graded metamaterial beam: with increasing
   frequency spacing, the attenuation region first becomes wider, then
   multiple discrete attenuation regions appear; and with increasing
   damping ratio, the transmittance response becomes flatter. A
   piezoelectric metamaterial beam is used to implement the proposed design
   strategy. Using a synthetic shunt circuit, the 'stiffness' of the local
   resonator can be tuned using a piezoelectric transducer. The FEM
   simulation results agree well with the developed theory for the graded
   metamaterial beam: with tuning of the capacitance spacing (2.4 nF), the
   attenuation bandwidth can be increased by about 172.8% as compared to
   the conventional one shunted with identical capacitances. (C) 2020

AB This study aims to treat heavy metal pollutants in water by applying red

   metal ions Pb2+ (or Cd2+ and Cu2+) by red mud particles was carried out,
   and the influences of the type of heavy metal ion, ion concentration, pH
   value, red mud dosage, reaction time, and temperature on adsorption
   performance were explored. The competitive adsorption mechanisms of
   various coexisting heavy metal ions by red mud particles were compared.
   The red mud samples loaded and not loaded with heavy metal ions were
   detected by zeta potential measurement, scanning electron microscopy,
   and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The adsorption strength of
   red mud particles for heavy metal ions was ranked in the sequence of
   Pb2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+, while increasing temperature enhanced their
   adsorption. When the initial pH values were 4.3, 5.0, and 3.6 for Pb2+,
   Cd2+, and Cu2+ solutions, the removal peaks were 94.5%, 92.8%, and
   78.1%, respectively. The preferred order of adsorption for red mud was
   Pb2+, Cd2+ and then Cu2+ under the competitive mechanism of
   binary/ternary systems due to the discrepancy in the functional groups
   of red mud particles loaded with different heavy metal ions. (c) 2022

   glucoside (APG-12) molecules on coal molecules and in turn study the
   dust suppression mechanism by APG-12 at the molecular level. Through
   wetting experiments, our preliminary findings showed that APG-12 does
   have a certain wetting effect on coal dust. According to density
   functional theory in molecular dynamics simulations, the electrostatic
   potential and surface charge of the APG-12 and coal molecular models
   were analyzed to identify their nucleophilic and electrophilic regions,
   and illustrate the hydrogen bond adsorption mechanism. The dynamics
   simulation results showed that APG-12 molecules can be easily adsorbed
   on the surface of coal molecules and then adsorb water molecules around
   them under the action of hydrogen bonds. This was consistent with the
   results of an analysis of the system?s radial distribution function and
   the relative concentration distribution of each component in the Z-axis
   direction. The results are in good agreement with the experimental
   results from scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive
   spectrometer analysis. These data provide further evidence that APG-12
   can clearly improve the wettability and suppression of coal dust, which
   is of great importance for controlling coal dust pollution.

AB Electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) and electrocoagulation
   (EC) are two promising techniques that have been used for the abatement
   of wide variety of organic contaminants. However, a few researchers have
   reported the combined use of these techniques for real wastewater, which
   is important for field implementation of the techniques. This article
   presents the comparative performance of combined sulfate radical based
   EAOP + EC and EC + EAOP processes for the treatment of real field dyeing
   wastewater. Pt/Ti plate was used as anode and iron plate was used as
   cathode. It was found that sulfate radical was generated by both
   cathodic reduction of persulfate and activation of persulfate by ferrous
   ions. Anodic oxidation by Pt/Ti anode and indirect electrochemical
   oxidation processes are also contributed in pollutant removal.
   Instantaneous current efficiency was found to increase with increase in
   persulfate concentration and with reduction in COD. EAOP followed by EC
   was found to be better approach than EC followed by EAOP as the former
   combination yielded higher COD reduction of 93.5% with lesser specific
   energy consumption and lesser sludge generation. Sludge generated after
   the treatment process was characterized using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray
   powder diffraction (XRD) techniques.

   diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   atomic force microscopy (AFM). Compared with the GO membrane, PAA@UiO/GO
   membrane combined the effects of GO, UiO-66-NH2 and PAA, which
   significantly enhances the separation performance of dye wastewater. In
   particular, the PAA@UiO/GO membrane can achieve complete removal of MB,
   RB and CR while the fluxes during filtration process can reach about 100
   L.m(-2).h(-1). At the same time, PAA@UiO/GO membrane almost retained
   stable removal rate on all dyes under extreme pH and ionic strength
   conditions. In addition, after 10 cycles of experiments, PAA@UiO/GO
   membrane retained a removal rate and a flux more than 95% and 85
   L.m(-2).h(-1) for all dyes, respectively. Compared to a composite
   membrane based on intercalation, the unique structure of PAA@UiO/GO
   membrane with a large number of adsorption sites and screening
   structures, resulting a better removal rate for dyes. Furthermore,
   PAA@UiO/GO membrane has a great potential in practical applications and
   a solution to balance trade-off effect.

AB The acceptance of renewable energy technologies is a complicated and
   multifaceted process influenced by a broad range of factors. Therefore,
   this study aims to examine the factors influencing consumer intention to
   utilize renewable energy (RE). Moreover, the current research highlights
   the factors that encourage or discourage consumers from utilizing RE by
   expanding the structural context of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)
   by integrating three new considerations (the perception of
   self-effectiveness, beliefs about the benefits of RE, and perception
   about neighbor participation). The data used for analysis were collected
   from 351 households in four large cities, including Rawalpindi, Lahore,
   Gujranwala, and Faisalabad, in Pakistan. We utilized the Structural
   Equation Modeling (SEM) approach to check the relationship between
   constructs and latent variables. The results reveal that the driving
   factors, i.e., the perception of self-effectiveness, awareness, and
   perception about neighbor participation have significant and positive
   effects on consumer intention to utilize RE. However, consumer beliefs
   related to the cost of RE utilization have a negative effect on their
   intention to utilize RE. More interestingly, it was observed that
   beliefs about the benefits of RE and environmental concern have
   insignificant effects. The outcomes of this study can assist policy
   makers, experts and consumers in understanding renewable energy
   consumption and gaining awareness about environmental problems while
   simultaneously improving environmental sustainability practices. (C)

AB Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a collective term for nanoscale or
   microscale vesicles secreted by cells that play important biological
   roles. Mesenchymal stem cells are a class of cells with the potential
   for self-healing and multidirectional differentiation. In recent years,
   numerous studies have shown that EVs, especially those secreted by
   mesenchymal stem cells, can promote the repair and regeneration of
   various tissues and, thus, have significant potential in regenerative
   medicine. However, due to the rapid clearance capacity of the
   circulatory system, EVs are barely able to act persistently at specific
   sites for repair of target tissues. Hydrogels have good biocompatibility
   and loose and porous structural properties that allow them to serve as
   EV carriers, thereby prolonging the retention in certain specific areas
   and slowing the release of EVs. When EVs are needed to function at
   specific sites, the EV-loaded hydrogels can stand as an excellent
   approach. In this review, we first introduce the sources, roles, and
   extraction and characterization methods of EVs and describe their
   current application status. We then review the different types of
   hydrogels and discuss factors influencing their abilities to carry and
   release EVs. We summarize several strategies for loading EVs into
   hydrogels and characterizing EV-loaded hydrogels. Further-more, we
   discuss application strategies for EV-loaded hydrogels and review their
   specific applications in tissue regeneration and repair. This article
   concludes with a summary of the current state of research on EV-loaded
   hydrogels and an outlook on future research directions, which we hope
   will provide promising ideas for researchers.

AB While using artificial intelligence (AI) could improve organizational
   decision-making, it also creates challenges associated with the "dark
   side" of AI. However, there is a lack of research on managers' attitudes
   and intentions to use AI for decision making. To address this gap, we
   develop an integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) to consider
   both the positive and negative factors that collectively influence
   managers' attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using AI. The
   research model is tested through a large-scale questionnaire survey of
   269 UK business managers. Our findings suggest that IAAAM provides a
   more comprehensive model for explaining and predicting managers'
   attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using AI. Our research
   contributes conceptually and empirically to the emerging literature on
   using AI for organizational decision-making. Further, regarding the
   practical implications of using AI for organizational decision-making,
   we highlight the importance of developing favorable facilitating
   conditions, having an effective mechanism to alleviate managers'
   personal concerns, and having a balanced consideration of both the
   benefits and the dark side associated with using AI.

AB Today, most organizations are undergoing a digital transformation. At
   the same time, the gravity of environmental issues has put
   sustainability and the circular economy at the top of corporate agendas.
   To this end, information systems, in particular business analytics, are
   being highlighted as essential enablers of an accelerated circular
   economy transition. However, effectively managing this joint
   transformation is a challenge. Firms struggle to identify which
   organizational resources they should target and how those should be
   leveraged towards a firm-wide business analytics capability for circular
   economy. To address these questions, this study draws on recent
   literature dealing with smart circular economy and business analytics
   capabilities along with the resource-based and resource orchestration
   view to (1) create an instrument to measure firms' business analytics
   capability for circular economy, and (2) examine the relationship among
   a circular economy-specific business analytics capability, circular
   economy implementation, resource orchestration capability, and firm
   performance. The proposed research model was tested using partial least
   squares structural equation modeling of survey data from 125 top-level
   managers at companies across Europe. The results show that firms with a
   strong business analytics capability have an increased resource
   orchestration capability and a greater ability to excel in the circular
   economy, resulting in improved organizational performance in building a
   more sustainable competitive advantage in an increasingly competitive
   business landscape. The effect of business analytics capability on firm
   performance is not direct but fully mediated through resource
   orchestration capability and circular economy implementation. The
   results empirically validate the proposed research model and offer
   pathways to future information systems research streams to support the
   operationalization of circular strategies. The study provides the first
   empirical evidence of a business analytics capability for circular
   economy and its effect on firm performance.

AB The electrochemo-mechanical effects on the structural integrity of
   electrode materials during cycling is a non-negligible factor that
   affects the cyclability and rate performance of all solid-state
   batteries (ASSBs). Herein, combined with in situ electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS), focused ion beam (FIB)-scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR)
   techniques, the electrochemical performance and electrochemo-mechanical
   behavior are compared of conventional polycrystalline NCM811
   (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2), small-size polycrystalline NCM811 and
   single-crystal (S-) NCM811 in Li10SnP2S12 based ASSBs during long
   charge-discharge cycles. The results show that the deteriorating
   performance of both large and small polycrystalline NCM811 originates
   from their inherent structural instability at >4.15 V, induced by the
   visible voids between the randomly oriented grains and microcracks due
   to the electrode pressing process and severe anisotropic volume change
   during cycling, rather than lithium ion transport in the primary
   particle. In contrast, S-NCM811 with good microstructural integrity show
   remarkably high capacity (187 mAh g(-1), 18 mA g(-1)), stable
   cyclability (100 cycles, retention of 64.5%), and exceptional rate
   capability (102 mAh g(-1) at 180 mA g(-1)) in ASSBs even without surface
   modification. Moreover, 1 wt% LiNbO3@S-NCM811 further demonstrates
   excellent initial discharge capacity and capacity retention. This work
   highlights the critical role of electrochemo-mechanical integrity and
   offers an promising path towards mechanically-reliable cathode materials
   for ASSBs.

AB This study examines the determinants of e-waste recycling intention
   among young consumers in an emerging economy context by integrating
   habits into a prominent model that predicts people's behav-iour, namely,
   the theory of planned behaviour. Young consumers contribute
   significantly to the outgrowth of e-waste problem as front-runners in
   the consumption, generation and management processes. Survey data have
   been analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling
   (PLSSEM) approach as a multivariate statistical method. The findings
   show that the integrated model can explain more than 47 per cent of the
   variance in the young consumers' e-waste recycling intention which
   reflects good explanatory power and confirms its robustness. The role of
   recycling habits and perceived attitudes are demonstrated as strong
   predictors of young adults' e-waste recycling intention. Surprisingly,
   constructs of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) involving subjective
   norms and behavioural control show no significant influence on the
   e-waste recycling intention of young consumers. Building on these
   findings, e-waste recycling programs should first target attitudes and
   create specific cues that trigger habits. The paper also concludes with
   several social and practical implications that can foster e waste
   recycling policies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   contained UHPC matrix. Different levels of MK were introduced into UHPC
   matrix owning a water to binder ratio (w/b) of 0.20. Consequently, the
   hydration, mechanical property and microstructures of UHPC matrix were
   investigated at various steam curing regimes with variable curing
   temperatures and durations. The compressive and flexural strength tests,
   chemically bound water, reaction of metakaolin, DTA, XRD analysis, as
   well as MIP and SEM measurements were performed for investigating
   relevant properties of UHPC matrix. The test results show that steam
   curing evidently improves the early age compressive strength of UHPC
   matrix while restrains the late age strength growth. The higher curing
   temperature facilitates a higher MK reaction degree in the MK
   incorporated mixture during early ages but decreases the cement
   hydration degree. However, increasing the steam curing duration from 24
   h to 48 h at both 55 and 90 degrees C does not significantly affect the
   facilitation of the pozzolanic reaction of MK. Pore structure of MK
   contained mixture with steam curing is similar to the reference with 20
   degrees C water curing at 28 d. The steam curing at 90 degrees C results
   in a higher porosity for the mixture blended with MK than that at 55
   degrees C. However, the enhanced porosity does not obviously impair the
   compressive strength of UHPC matrix. Therefore, a suitable steam curing
   regime is required for UHPC matrix containing MK to enhance the strength
   and long-term durability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   superior catalyst was successfully prepared, and then doped into MgH2
   via ball milling to improve the de/rehydrogenation properties of MgH2 at
   low temperatures. Compared with as-prepared MgH2, the onset desorption
   temperature could be reduced to 175 degrees C after adding 15 wt%-TiFe
   to MgH2. Furthermore, the 10 wt%-TiFe doped MgH2 released approximately
   6.5 wt% H2 within 10 min at 300 degrees C, and 5.3 wt% H2 could be
   rapidly absorbed at low temperature of 125 degrees C under hydrogen
   pressure of 3 MPa. Moreover, the additional doping of carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) evenly distributed on the surface of MgH2 particles, enabling the
   MgH2 + 10 wt%-TiFe + 5 wt%-CNTs composite with outstanding cycling
   performance. The activation energy of hydrogenation for MgH2 was reduced
   from 72.5 +/- 2.7 kJ/mol to 60.7 +/- 8.0 kJ/mol after doping with TiFe
   and CNTs. However, the addition of TiFe and CNTs had limited influence
   on the thermodynamic properties of MgH2. The analysis of XRD, TEM, SEM
   and EDS indicated that uniformly distributed TiFe and CNTs served as
   active catalytic unit and aggregation preventer on enhancing the
   hydrogen storage properties of MgH2, respectively.

AB The current COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly into one of the most
   devastating public health crises in recent history. By mid-July 2020,
   reported cases exceeded 13 million worldwide, with at least 575,000
   deaths and 7.33 million people recovered. In Oman, over 61,200 confirmed
   cases have been reported with an infection rate of 1.3. Spatial modeling
   of disease transmission is important to guide the response to the
   epidemic at the subnational level. Sociodemographic and healthcare
   factors such as age structure, population density, long-term illness,
   hospital beds and nurse practitioners can be used to explain and predict
   the spatial transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, this research aimed to
   examine whether the relationships between the incidence rates and these
   covariates vary spatially across Oman. Global Ordinary Least Squares
   (OLS), spatial lag and spatial error regression models (SLM, SEM), as
   well as two distinct local regression models (Geographically Weighted
   Regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression
   MGWR), were applied to explore the spatially non-stationary
   relationships. As the relationships between these covariates and
   COVID-19 incidence rates vary geographically, the local models were able
   to express the non-stationary relationships among variables.
   Furthermore, among the eleven selected regressors, elderly population
   aged 65 and above, population density, hospital beds, and diabetes rates
   were found to be statistically significant determinants of COVID-19
   incidence rates. In conclusion, spatial information derived from this
   modeling provides valuable insights regarding the spatially varying
   relationship of COVID-19 infection with these possible drivers to help
   establish preventative measures to reduce the community incidence rate.

AB Purpose One popular method to assess discriminant validity in structural
   equation modeling is the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations
   (HTMT). However, the HTMT assumes tau-equivalent measurement models,
   which are unlikely to hold for most empirical studies. To relax this
   assumption, the authors modify the original HTMT and introduce a new
   consistent measure for congeneric measurement models: the HTMT2.
   Design/methodology/approach The HTMT2 is designed in analogy to the HTMT
   but relies on the geometric mean instead of the arithmetic mean. A Monte
   Carlo simulation compares the performance of the HTMT and the HTMT2. In
   the simulation, several design factors are varied such as loading
   patterns, sample sizes and inter-construct correlations in order to
   compare the estimation bias of the two criteria. Findings The HTMT2
   provides less biased estimations of the correlations among the latent
   variables compared to the HTMT, in particular if indicators loading
   patterns are heterogeneous. Consequently, the HTMT2 should be preferred
   over the HTMT to assess discriminant validity in case of congeneric
   measurement models. Research limitations/implications However, the HTMT2
   can only be determined if all correlations between involved observable
   variables are positive. Originality/value This paper introduces the
   HTMT2 as an improved version of the traditional HTMT. Compared to other
   approaches assessing discriminant validity, the HTMT2 provides two
   advantages: (1) the ease of its computation, since HTMT2 is only based
   on the indicator correlations, and (2) the relaxed assumption of
   tau-equivalence. The authors highly recommend the HTMT2 criterion over

AB Although the existing literature on green innovation has little focus on
   the mediation role of open innovation, we aimed to explore how
   intellectual property rights and government support affect green
   innovation through open innovation. Drawing upon open innovation
   literature, this paper aims to investigate, at the firm level, the
   structural causality between internal and external resources and examine
   the role of open innovation on green innovation divided into green
   process and green product innovation. We attempt to suggest a structural
   model comparing open innovation's direct and mediating role using data
   from manufacturing sectors in South Korea from 2014 to 2016. The
   methodology was based on the partial least square structural equation
   method (PLS-SEM) with 1203 samples. The results revealed that a firm's
   intellectual property rights and government support significantly affect
   open innovation, green process innovation, and green product innovation
   while open innovation played a mediating role between each.
   Additionally, we provide a supplementary analysis using the sample-split
   test by comparing the sensitivity to partner selection and the
   multigroup test by firm size. This study proposes several implications
   emphasizing the mediating role of open innovation in enhancing green
   process innovation along with the direct and indirect effect of
   intellectual property rights and government support on green innovation.

AB The production of disposable plastic face masks (DPFs) in China alone
   has reached to approximately 200 million a day, in a global effort to
   tackle the spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, improper and
   unregulated disposals of these DPFs has been and will continue to
   intensify the plastic pollution problem we are already facing. This
   study focuses on the emission of pollutants from 7 DPF brands that were
   submerged in water to simulate environmental conditions if these DPFs
   were littered. The DPF leachates were filtered by inorganic membranes,
   and both particle-deposited organic membranes and the filtrates were
   characterized using techniques such as FTIR, SEM-EDX, Light Microscopy,
   ICP-MS and LC-MS. Micro and nano scale polymeric fibres, particles,
   siliceous fragments and leachable inorganic and organic chemicals were
   observed from all of the tested DPFs. Traces of concerning heavy metals
   (i.e. lead up to 6.79 mu g/L) were detected in association with silicon
   containing fragments. ICP-MS also confirmed the presence of other
   leachable metals like cadmium (up to 1.92 mu g/L), antimony (up to 393
   mu g/L) and copper (up to 4.17 mu g/L). LC-MS analysis identified polar
   leachable organic species related to plastic additives and contaminants;
   polyamide-66 monomer and oligomers (nylon-66 synthesis), surfactant
   molecules, dye-like molecules and polyethylene glycol were all
   tentatively identified in the leachate. The toxicity of some of the
   chemicals found and the postulated risks of the rest of the present
   particles and molecules, raises the question of whether DPFs are safe to
   be used on a daily basis and what consequences are to be expected after
   their disposal into the environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In this work, we successfully synthesized novel polymer gel beads based
   on functionalized iron oxide (Fe3O4), activated charcoal (AC) particles
   with beta-cyclodextrin (CD) and sodium alginate (SA) polymer
   (Fe3O4/CD/AC/SA), by a simple, reproducible and inexpensive method.
   These beads proved to be versatile and strong adsorbents with magnetic
   properties and high adsorption capacity. The composites were
   characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning
   electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, vibrating
   sample magnetometry, adsorption at -196 degrees C, high resolution
   transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and point
   of zero charge measurements. Two dyes, two drugs and one metal were used
   to test the adsorption capability of the prepared polymer nanocomposite.
   The adsorbent showed good removal efficiencies for the studied
   pollutants, especially the cationic dyes and the metal, when compared to
   other low-cost adsorbents. The saturated adsorption capacity of
   Fe3O4/CD/AC/SA reached 5.882 mg g-1 for methyl violet (MV), 2.283 mg g-1
   for brilliant green (BG), 2.551 mg g-1 for norfloxacin (NOX), 3.125 mg
   g-1 for ciprofloxacin (CPX), 10.10 mg g-1 for copper metal ion (Cu(II)).
   The adsorption isotherm studies showed that data fitted well with
   Langmuir and Temkin isotherms models. The kinetic data showed good
   correlation coefficient with low error function for the pseudo-second
   order kinetic model. The data analysis was carried out using error and
   regression coefficient functions for the estimation of best-fitting
   isotherm and kinetic models, namely: chi-square test (chi 2) and sum of
   the squares of errors (SSE). The activation energy was found to be 47.68
   kJ mol-1 for BG, 29.09 kJ mol-1 for MV, 28.93 kJ mol-1 for NOX, 4.53 kJ
   mol-1 for CPX and 17.08 kJ mol-1 for Cu(II), which represent
   chemisorption and physisorption behavior of sorbent molecules. The
   polymer composites can be regenerated and easily separated from aqueous
   solution without any weight loss. After regeneration, the Fe3O4/CD/AC/SA
   beads still have good adsorption capacities up to four cycles of
   desorption and adsorption. The results indicate that the polymer gel
   beads are promising adsorbents for the removal of different categories
   of toxicants (like dyes, drugs and metal) in single adsorbate aqueous
   systems. Thus, the novel Fe3O4/CD/AC/SA beads can be effectively
   employed for a large-scale applications as environmentally compatible
   materials for the adsorption of different categories of pollutants.

AB Microplastics (MPs) with sizes < 5 mm are found in various compositions,
   shapes, morphologies, and textures that are the major sources of
   environmental pollution. The fraction of MPs in total weight of plastic
   accumulation around the world is predicted to be 13.2% by 2060. These
   micron-sized MPs are hazardous to marine species, birds, animals, soil
   creatures and humans due to their occurrence in air, water, soil, indoor
   dust and food items. The present review covers discussions on the
   damaging effects of MPs on the environment and their removal techniques
   including biodegradation, adsorption, catalytic, photocatalytic
   degradation, coagulation, filtration and electro-coagulation. The main
   techniques used to analyze the structural and surface changes such as
   cracks, holes and erosion post the degradation processes are FTIR and
   SEM analysis. In addition, reduction in plastic molecular weight by the
   microbes implies disintegration of MPs. Adsorptive removal by the
   magnetic adsorbent promises complete elimination while the biodegradable
   catalysts could remove 70-100% of MPs. Catalytic degradation via
   advanced oxidation assisted by SO4 center dot- or OH center dot radicals
   generated by peroxymonosulfate or sodium sulfate are also adequately
   covered in addition to photocatalysis. The chemical methods such as
   sol-gel, agglomeration, and coagulation in conjunction with other
   physical methods are discussed concerning the drinking
   water/wastewater/sludge treatments. The efficacy, merits and demerits of
   the currently used removal approaches are reviewed that will be helpful
   in developing more sophisticated technologies for the complete
   mitigation of MPs from the environment.

AB Pectin-rich dietary fibers were prepared from citrus peel through
   alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment (AHP-CF) or homogenization
   treatment (H-CF). Structural and physicochemical properties of the
   citrus fibers were evaluated and compared with a commercial one
   (Fiberstar). Results showed that pectin content of citrus fibers (CF)
   increased from 15.23% to 21.52% and 26.79% after AHP and homogenization
   treatment. AHP-CF had the highest water-holding capacity (WHC) (21.32
   g/g), water-swelling capacity (WSC) (32.70 mL/g) and cation exchange
   capacity (CEC) (1.02 Meq/g) among the fibers. SEM results showed porous
   or wrinkled surface of the treated CFs. XRD and TG analysis indicated
   that AHP treatment increased the crystallinity and thermal stability of
   CF while homogenization treatment was the opposite. Besides, H-CF had
   similar chemical component, oil holding capacity and CEC with Fiberstar
   but higher WHC, WSC and thermal stability. These results suggested that
   AHP-CF and H-CF might be suitable to be an additive used in functional
   food.

AB This study was aimed at evaluating the effects of alkali activator
   solution and utilization of silica fume (SF) on durability and
   microstructural characteristics of alkali-activated ground granulated
   blast furnace slag (GGBFS) pastes. The pastes were activated with sodium
   silicate (SS) blended with NaOH (SH) solution with molar concentrations
   of 8 M, 12 M, and 16 M and SS:SH ratios of 1.0, 2.5, and 4.0. The same
   mixes were prepared with SF as partial replacement of GGBFS at a dosage
   of 10% by weight. The initial and final water absorption as well as the
   electrical resistivity of the specimens were measured. The optimal paste
   fabricated with 12 M NaOH solution and SS:SH ratio of 2.5 showed the
   lowest water absorption and the highest electrical resistivity.
   Inclusion of SF reduced the final water absorption by 29% and increased
   the electrical resistivity by 62% compared to the same mix without SF.
   The observations were confirmed by the results of scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) where the optimal paste showed a dense matrix with few
   pores. Furthermore, the chemical composition of the pastes was studied
   through energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   analyses. Moreover, the resistance to aggressive environment conditions
   of the pastes was examined through exposure to 5% hydrochloric acid and
   nitric acid up to 90 days. Generally, specimens were more resistant to
   nitrates. The specimens showed about 5-8% increase in their compressive
   strength compared to the unconditioned specimens during the first 28
   days; however, up to 22% reduction in compressive strength was noticed
   after 90 days of exposure. It was shown that SS:SH ratio has a higher
   contribution to acid attack resistance of alkali-activated slag (AAS)
   pastes. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB As a natural reduction mineral, pyrite (FeS2), was combined with biochar
   by simply ball milling technology to synthesize FeS2@biochar composite
   (BM-FeS2@BC) and applied for the removal of hexavalent chromium (Cr
   (VI)) in aqueous solution. SEM, XRD, FTIR, and XPS characterization
   results showed that the FeS2 and biochar were successfully combined and
   biochar suppressed the agglomeration of FeS2. Batch sorption experiments
   showed that the BM-FeS2@BC700 composite (mass ratio of FeS2-to-biochar =
   3:1) had enhanced Cr(VI) removal capacity of 134 mg?g- 1, which were
   3?25 times higher than those of the corresponding pristine and
   ball-milled biochar and FeS2. The removal of Cr(VI) by BM-FeS2@BC700 was
   dosage and pH dependent. The addition of oxalic acid (OA) exhibited a
   promotion effect on the removal of Cr(VI) by increasing the removal rate
   of Cr(VI) from 56% to 100%. Reduction, adsorption, and surface
   complexation were the dominate mechanisms for Cr(VI) removal by
   BM-FeS2@BC700. At the equilibrium Cr(VI) concentration of 15.7 mg?L-1,
   92.25% of Cr(VI) was removed through reduction/precipitation and 8.75%
   was removed by adsorption/surface complexation. The fitting results of
   the Langmuir model proved that the removal of Cr(VI) by BM-FeS2@BC700
   composite was chemical surface monolayer adsorption. This work
   demonstrates the potential of ball milling for the preparation of
   FeS2@BC composite to remove Cr(VI) from water and wastewater.

AB Electric vehicles have significantly contributed to the sustainability
   of world economic growth. It is of critical importance to understand and
   examine the factors impacting the consumers' attitude toward the
   adoption of electric vehicles. However, limited study investigated the
   effect of altruism on electric vehicles adoption from a
   pro-environmental behaviour perspective. Therefore, the present work
   aimed at identifying the influencing factors on consumers' intention to
   use electric vehicles. To this end, a model has been developed based on
   two theoretical models called the Norm Activation Model and the Theory
   of Planned Behaviour. The potential consumers in Malaysia were selected
   to answer questionnaires. Accordingly, 177 valid questionnaires were
   collected and the influencing factors on the electric vehicles purchase
   intention were empirically analyzed using a structural equation model.
   According to the results, perceived value, attitude, the ascription of
   responsibility, subjective norms, personal norms, perceived consumer
   effectiveness, and awareness of consequences affected the consumers'
   electric vehicles' purchase intention significantly and positively.
   Consumers' behaviour regarding the adoption of electric vehicles can be
   understood better through the findings of this study, while electric
   vehicle development can be promoted as well. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

   results demonstrated that highly dispersed nanoscale Fe-0/Cu-0
   (nFe(0)/Cu-0) were successfully introduced into the montmorillonite
   (MMT) layers. In the reaction process, the combination of Cu-0 and Fe-0
   acted as a galvanic cell, and electrocorrosion not only speeded up the
   reaction rate, but also increased reduction activity of nFe(0).
   MMT-nFe(0)/Cu-0 as an excellent carrier had good functions in dispersing

   and their photocatalytic activities for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation
   were assessed. Compared with the benchmark TiO2 photocatalyst (P25), the
   Cx/TiO2 composite material with high specific surface, lower band gap,
   and reduced photogenerated electron hole ratio exhibited outstanding
   photodegradation activity and durability for BPA, which could be
   attributed to the combined effect of co-doping of multiple carbon
   species (substituent carbon and carbonate) and porous structure. During
   BPA degradation, the holes and superoxide radicals were the primary role
   oxidative species in the reaction process. Therefore, this new efficient
   photo catalyst is promising candidate for photodegradation of organic
   pollutants.

AB There have always been numerous challenges to designing a
   cost-effectiveness, reusable and robust adsorbents for simultaneous
   heavy metal ion remediations from wastewaters. Herein, a novel kind of
   nanocomposite relying on the synergic impact of magnetic Fe3O4, FeMoS4-
   2, and magnesium-aluminum layered double hydroxide (MgAl-LDH) using
   loading the FeMoS4- 2 on protonated Fe3O4 and adhered to the surface of
   Mg/Al-LDH (Fe3O4/ FeMoS4/MgAl-LDH). The nanocage structures adsorbent
   was characterized via FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM, EDX, and VSM techniques and
   demonstrated having an efficient adsorption capability to common
   cationic pollutants (Pb (II), Cd (II) and Cu (II) by batch experiments.
   Disparate chief parameters affecting adsorption performance, including
   Fe3O4/FeMoS4/MgAl-LDH mass, metal ion concentrations, solution pH, and
   contact time were considered and optimized through central composite
   design (CCD) in detail. Its supreme adsorption efficiency toward Pb
   (II), Cd (II), and Cu (II) accounted for 190.75, 140.50, and 110.25 mg
   g-1, respectively, which acquired by the Langmuir model under the
   parameter set at 60 min contact time, solution pH at 5, 0.03 g the
   Fe3O4/FeMoS4/MgAl-LDH and metal ion concentrations ranging from 10 to
   300 mg L-1. Such enhancement stemmed from the coordinated complexes in
   the LDH interlayer region and electrostatic attraction between
   Fe3O4/FeMoS4/MgAl-LDH and metal ions. Furthermore, the adsorption
   conducts were more consistent with the pseudo-second-order model and the
   Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. Likewise, the features such as
   the superior regeneration and reusability allow the
   Fe3O4/FeMoS4/MgAl-LDH nanocomposite to constitute as one of the
   promising materials for heavy metals remediation in wastewater.

AB Biochar, due to its ability to remediate heavy metals and organic
   contaminants from polluted water is considered as an economic adsorption
   material. This work involved pyrolysis driven eucalyptus carbon (EC) to
   produce eucalyptus activated carbon (AC) through a novel mechanism of
   using phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and its subsequent testing for efficient
   adsorption of Cr (VI) from aqueous environments. Advanced
   characterization techniques like XRD, SEM, BET, FTIR, and XPS were
   employed to characterize the structure and composition of EC and AC. The
   AC could remove 99.76% of Cr(VI), which was higher than EC removal rate
   of 25.24%. The surface area of AC increased by almost 5 times 1265.56
   m(2)/g compared to EC (253.25 m(2)/g). The removal rate of Cr(VI) was
   highly influenced by adsorption capacity, pH, adsorption time,
   temperature, kinetics, and isotherm. Reaction rate kinetics, isothermal,
   and thermodynamic analysis revealed that the adsorption curve of AC fits
   well with the quasi-second-order kinetic model. AC adsorption process
   was a spontaneous endothermic reaction limited by intraparticle
   diffusion and a combination of chemical and physical adsorption. (C)

AB The layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are potential non-noble metal
   photocatalysts. Unfortunately, the intrinsic activity of bulk LDHs is
   relatively low, which limits their use. Herein, the ultrathin, porous
   and vacancy-rich CoAl-LDHs nanosheets were prepared by exfoliation
   strategy. Then, they were assembled with the early transition-metal
   carbides nanosheets (MXenes, Ti3C2Tx) to afford a hybrid 2D/2D
   CoAl-LDHs/Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst via electrostatic assembly process. The
   experiments indicated that the CoAl-LDHs/Ti3C2Tx hybrids performed an
   excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity for tetracycline
   hydrochloride (96.67 %) degradation. Diversified characterization
   techniques (SEM, TEM, AFM, N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis, XRD,
   FTIR, UV-vis DRS, photoelectrochemical test) and density functional
   theory calculations (electronic and optical properties) have indicated
   that such excellent photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the synergy
   and the Schottky heterojunction formation between CoAl-LDHs nanosheets
   and Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, which possessed markedly visible-light
   absorption, high specific surface area, rapid electrons transfer and
   depressed electron-hole pairs recombination.

AB An ultrasensitive bionic MXene based piezoresistive pressure sensor was
   rationally designed and realized by molding the microstructure of the
   ginkgo leaf. Specifically, the core deformation part of the sensor under
   the applied force has been fabricated by imprinting the array-like
   microscopic shapes of the ginkgo leaves. The MXene-based pressure sensor
   was prepared by spraying the MXene onto the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   model film with the ginkgo leaf structure. To further enhance the
   sensitivity, a layer of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber fabricated by the
   electrospinning method was weaved between the MXene-based element and
   the electrodes in the sensor. Then, the obtained pressure sensor
   demonstrated ultrahigh sensitivity of 403.46 kPa(-1), short response
   time of 99.3 ms and extraordinary durability with 12,000
   loading-unloading cycles. Furthermore, the microstructure change of the
   sensor under applied pressure was observed through the in-situ scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) experiment. Meanwhile, the pressure sensor
   also displays great potential applications ranging from the
   physiological signal test to the human-computer interaction field.

AB In this study, biomass of grass waste (GW) was utilized as sustainable
   precursor to produce highly porous activated carbon (GWAC) with
   mesoporosity using a K2CO3-assisted pyrolysis approach and tested for
   its methylene blue (MB) dye adsorption properties. The prepared GWAC was
   characterized using the various techniques of specific surface area
   (SSA), Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX),
   Xray diffractometer (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier
   Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer. The characterization
   results indicate the successful conversion of GW into mesoporous GWAC
   with high and desirable surface area of 1245.6 m(2)/g. The adsorptive
   performance of GWAC towards MB uptake was evaluated. To attain higher
   performance of the activated carbon for MB adsorption, the adsorption
   key parameters such as GWAC dosage (A: 0.04-0.06 g/L), pH (B: 4-10),
   temperature (C: 30-60 degrees C), and time (D: 5-15 min) were optimized
   using the Box-Behnken design (BBD) method. The adsorption equilibrium
   data were accurately described by the Langmuir model, where the
   adsorption capacity (qm; 364.2 mg/g) was recorded at the optimized
   process temperature of 45 degrees C. The present research also examined
   the mechanisms associated with the removal of MB using GWAC and observed
   the contribution of various MB-GWAC surface interactions (e.g.,
   electrostatic, pi-pi, and H-bonding interactions). The present
   investigation shows the utility and effectiveness of GW biomass based
   activated carbon due to its favorable mesoporosity and cationic dye
   uptake in aqueous media.

AB The methods of enzymatic extraction (EE), acid extraction (ACE), and
   alkali extraction (ALE) were applied for extracting the soluble and
   insoluble dietary fiber (SDF and IDF) based on the kiwifruits. The
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), molecular weight, Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), monosaccharide composition, and thermal
   properties were adopted for characterizing dietary fiber samples. This
   study demonstrated that, all the dietary fiber samples showed
   representative infrared spectral features of polysaccharides (LPS),
   whereas AC-IDF and E-SDF had the looser and more complicated structures.
   AL-IDF displayed greater thermal stability among IDFs, and there was no
   significant difference in the thermal stability of SDFs. Both ACIDF and
   AC-SDF had higher molecular weights among the various IDFs and SDFs. In
   addition, the extraction method indeed had certain effect on the
   monosaccharide composition in dietary fiber samples. Furthermore, ESDF,
   E-IDF, AC-SDF and AC-IDF exhibited higher glucose adsorption capacity
   (GAC), oil-holding capacity (OHC), water-holding capacity (WHC), bile
   acid binding capacity (BABC), and nitrite ion adsorption capacity (NIAC)
   than those of AL-SDF and AL-IDF. To sum up, our results indicate that,
   the kiwifruit-derived dietary fiber samples may potentially serve as the
   functional food ingredient.

   analysis. The synthesized nanocomposite was used as a nanoadditive for
   the improvement of polyethersulfone (PES) polymeric membrane. The phase
   inversion route was used to prepare MoS2/O-MWCNTs blended membranes
   containing different amounts of nanocomposite (0-1 wt%). The morphology
   of the prepared membranes was studied using SEM and atomic force
   microscopy techniques. Asymmetric structure with small pores at the top
   layer and well-developed large finger-like pores and macro voids at the
   sublayer can be observed in fabricated membranes. The hydrophilicity
   enhancement of the PES membrane in the existence of nanocomposite was
   verified by the contact angle test. The modified membrane containing

AB Compared with the transition metal induced homogeneous catalytic system,
   the heterogeneous catalytic system based on transition metal-doped metal
   organic frameworks (MOFs) were stable for the efficient utilization of
   transition metal and avoiding the metal leaching. The aim of this work
   is to synthesize Co doped MIL-53(Al) by one-step solvent thermal method
   and use it to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to remove tetracycline
   (TC) in water. The successful synthesis of Co-MIL-53(Al) samples was
   demonstrated by XDR, SEM and FTIR characterizations. The 25%
   Co-MIL-53(Al)/PMS system showed the optimal TC removal effect compared
   to the PMS alone and MIL-53(Al)/PMS system. The catalytic performances
   of Co-MIL-53(Al)/PMS system in conditions of different pH, co-existing
   substances and water bodies were investigated. Quenching experiment and
   electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) showed that the degradation
   mechanism by Co-MIL-53(Al) activation PMS was mainly attributed to
   sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2))
   non-radical. The degradation intermediates of TC were also identified
   and the possible degradation pathways were proposed. Co-MIL-53(Al)
   showed good activity after four cycles. These findings demonstrated that
   Co-MIL-53(Al) can be a promising heterogeneous catalyst for activating
   PMS to degrade TC. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The construction of a lunar base and habitation on the Moon has always
   been on researchers' minds. Building materials used in in situ lunar
   resources are of great significance for saving expensive space freight.
   In this study, a new type of lunar soil simulant named Beihang (BH)-1
   was developed. The chemical mineral composition and microstructure of
   BH-1 closely resemble those of real lunar soil, as verified by X-ray
   fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), and reflectance spectra. This research also
   synthesized a geopolymer based on BH-1 cured at simulated lunar
   atmospheric conditions. We also investigated the effect of supplementing
   aluminum (Al) sources on the enhancement of geopolymer strength based on
   BH-1. The rheological behavior of alkali-activated BH-1 pastes was
   determined for workability. XRF, XRD, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, SEM coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy, and Al-27
   magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance were used to
   characterize resulting geopolymers. Rheological test findings showed
   that the rheology of BH-1 pastes fits the Herschel-Bulkley model, and
   they behaved like a shear-thinning fluid. The results showed that the
   28-day compressive strength of the BH-1 geopolymer was improved by up to
   100.8%. Meanwhile, the weight of additives required to produce per unit
   strength decreased, significantly reducing the mass of materials
   transported from the Earth for the construction of lunar infrastructure
   and saving space transportation costs. Microscopic analyses showed that
   the mechanism to improve the mechanical properties of the BH-1
   geopolymer by adding an additional Al source enhances the replacement of
   silicon atoms by Al atoms in the silicon-oxygen group and generates a
   more complete and dense amorphous gel structure. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

AB Ce-MOF/CNTs nanocomposites were prepared by a simple method and
   post-treated with NaOH/H2O2 mixed solution. The morphology and structure
   of the treated samples were characterized by transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that
   the post treatment induces the Ce-MOF morphological changing from
   rod-like structure into particles, which are covered on the surface of
   CNTs. XPS demonstrates that there are twovalence (TV) of Ce3+/Ce4+ in
   the post-treated Ce-MOF/CNTs (TV) composite. The electrochemical
   behaviors of nanocomposite were also investigated on electrochemical
   work station. By utilization of the good electrical conductivity of CNT,
   the two-valence of Ce and the high surface area of MOF, the
   nanocomposites were used to fabricate the electrochemical sensor for the
   simultaneous electrochemical detection of hydroquinone (HQ) and catechol
   (CC). Compared to the Ce-MOF/CNTs/GCE, the post-treated Ce-MOF
   (TV)/CNTs/GCE exhibited two well-defined peaks for the electrochemical
   oxidation of HQ and CC. The linear ranges responding to HQ and CC are 10
   - 100 mu M and 5 - 50 mu M respectively.

AB In this research, a magnetic-activated carbon composite was synthesized
   to investigate its adsorption to methylene blue dye. Active carbon (ACz)
   was produced by ZnCl2 activation of coconut shell (char: ZnCl2, 2:1).
   Magnetic activated carbon (MACz) was prepared via an easy method by
   chemical co-precipitation of Fe3+/Fe2+. The pore diameter, pore-volume,
   and surface area of MACz were determined from N-2 adsorption isotherms.
   The ACz and MACz were characterized by several techniques such as BET,
   SEM/EDX, FT-IR, XRF, VSM, TGA, and pHpzc analysis. The average particle
   size, particle size distribution, and zeta potential of MACz were
   determined by Zetasizer. The zero point charge of the MACz was
   determined as approximately 4.9 pH. Moreover, the adsorption by MACz was
   investigated as kinetically and thermodynamically for removal of
   methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. The kinetics and
   thermodynamic parameters were also calculated. According to the results,
   the adsorption process was determined as endothermic. The Langmuir and
   Freundlich isotherms models were used and it was found that adsorption
   of MB onto MACz best fitted to Freundlich model according to RMSE, SSE,
   and R-2 values. The maximum adsorption capacity of the composite was
   calculated as 156.25 mg/g. Thermodynamic parameters (Delta H degrees,
   Delta G degrees, and Delta S degrees) were also calculated, which
   revealed that the adsorption process is spontaneous. (C) 2021 Elsevier

AB As the industrial waste from blast furnace ironmaking, air-cooled blast
   furnace slag (ACBFS) puts a lot of pressure on the environment. It is
   becoming more and more urgent to deal with the increasing ACBFS. In this
   study, the concept of "full-volume slag alkali-activated mortars (FSAM)"
   is proposed using ground granulated water-cooled blast furnace slag
   (GGBS) as aluminosilicate material and ACBFS to replace machine-made
   sand, aiming to solve the current situation of increasing scarcity of
   natural resources. The characteristics of ACBFS are investigated, and
   its stability and heavy metal leaching all meet the requirements as a
   building material. The results show that the flowability and mechanical
   properties of FSAM are significantly enhanced with the substitution rate
   of ACBFS increases. Meanwhile, the incorporation of ACBFS is also
   beneficial to improve the compactness of the microstructure of the
   mortar, thereby improving the impermeability (Water, ion and gas) of
   FSAM. In addition, the specimen mixed with ACBFS showed good high
   temperature resistance due to the porous feature of the aggregate.
   Furthermore, using a small amount of limestone powder to replace GGBS
   can slightly improve the performance of FSAM. Therefore, ACBFS is
   recommended to be used in FSAM, which meets safety, cost and
   environmental benefits.

   dye adsorption with ultra-high capacity of 1265.82 mg/g. Adsorption
   performance of MnUiO-66@GO-NH2 composite and effect of pH on its
   adsorption capacity were investigated. The adsorption process fitted
   well with pseudo-second order and both Langmuir and Freundlich models.
   Thermodynamic of the process showed that the adsorption of CR on
   Mn-UiO-66@GO-NH2 composite is an endothermic process. In addition,
   MnUiO-66@GO-NH2 composite displays a good adsorption selectivity toward
   CR among two other dyes cationic methylene blue (MB) and anionic methyl
   orange (MO). The mechanism of the removal is proposed to be a
   combination of electrostatic attraction, pi-pi stacking, hydrogen

   Mn-UiO-66@GO-NH2 composite can be applied for practical wastewater

AB Microplastics (MPs) exposed to the natural environment provide an ideal
   surface for biofilm formation, which potentially acts as a reactive
   phase facilitating the sorption of hazardous contaminants. Until now,
   changes in the contaminant sorption capacity of MPs due to biofilm
   formation have not been quantified. This is the first study that
   compared the capacity of naturally aged, biofilm-covered microplastic
   fibers (BMFs) to adsorb perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and lead (Pb)
   at environmentally relevant concentrations. Changes in the surface
   properties and morphology of aged microplastic fibers (MF) were studied
   by surface area analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron
   microscopy. Results revealed that aged MFs exhibited higher surface
   areas because of biomass accumulation compared to virgin samples and
   followed the order polypropylene>polyethylene>nylon>polyester. The
   concentrations of adsorbed Pb and PFOS were 4-25% and 20-85% higher in
   aged MFs and varied among the polymer types. The increased contaminant
   adsorption was linked with the altered surface area and the
   hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics of the samples. Overall, the
   present study demonstrates that biofilms play a decisive role in
   contaminant-plastic interactions and significantly enhance the vector
   potential of MFs for toxic environmental contaminants. We anticipate
   that knowledge generated from this study will help refine the planetary
   risk assessment of MPs.

AB In higher educational institutes, developing classrooms for active
   learning is becoming a part of comprehensive educational drive for
   students involving and engaging in learning. For this purpose, influence
   of social factors on collaborative learning and engagement has been
   investigated which will influence learning performance of students. The
   study looked at following areas: (a) the ability of social factors for
   developing collaborative learning and engagement and (b) whether
   collaborative learning and engagement mediate a link between social
   factors and student's learning performance. Constructivism theory has
   been utilized to observe the student's learning behavior. Data have been
   collected through questionnaires from university students. Findings
   evaluated through structural equation modeling (SEM), shows that social
   factors, i.e. interaction with peers and teachers, social presence, and
   usage of social media positively impact active collaborative learning
   and student involvement, thus affecting their learning performance. The
   findings also provide evidence for double mediation used in this study.
   As online learning is becoming more prevalent in education, it has been
   concluded that overall collaborative learning and engagement with
   influence of social factors improve activities of students learning;
   therefore, their usage should be stimulated in teaching and learning in
   higher educational institutions as it influences students' academic
   development.

AB The effective utilization of multimodal data (e.g., hyperspectral and
   light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data) has profound implications for
   further development of the remote sensing (RS) field. Many studies have
   explored how to effectively fuse features from multiple modalities;
   however, few of them focus on information interactions that can
   effectively promote the complementary semantic content of multisource
   data before fusion. In this letter, we propose a spatial-spectral
   enhancement module ((SEM)-E-2) for cross-modal information interaction
   in deep neural networks. Specifically, (SEM)-E-2 consists of SpAtial
   Enhancement Module (SAEM) for enhancing spatial representation of
   hyperspectral data by LiDAR features and SpEctral Enhancement Module
   (SEEM) for enhancing spectral representation of LiDAR data by
   hyperspectral features. A series of experiments and ablation studies on
   the Houston2013 dataset show that (SEM)-E-2 can effectively facilitate
   the interaction and understanding between multimodal data. Our source
   code is available at
   https://github.com/likyoo/Multimodal-Remote-Sensing-Toolkit,
   contributing to the RS community.

AB Reduced graphene oxide based iron oxide modified titania
   (rGO-Fe3O4/TiO2) was developed as a low-cost, stable, and reproducible
   photocatalyst, synthesized by conventional hydrothermal route.
   Structural and morphological features were investigated by X-Ray
   diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier Transform
   Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and
   Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The incorporation of rGO-Fe3O4 to
   TiO2 shifted the light absorption of TiO2 from ultraviolet (UV) to
   visible region. The band gap energy of the synthesized photocatalyst
   rGO-Fe3O4/TiO2 reduced to 2.6 eV as compared to TiO2 (3.2 eV) which
   shifted the light absorption into visible region in order to utilize the
   solar energy effectually. The as-proposed rGO-Fe3O4/TiO2 and TiO2
   photocatalysts were used for the photodegradation of malachite green
   (MG) and methylene blue (MB) degradation. The as-prepared photocatalyst
   rGO-Fe3O4/TiO2 exhibited commendable photocatalytic efficiency (99%)
   comparative to pure TiO2 (67%) under visible light in 55 min for MG
   degradation. The active species were also identified using various
   scavengers by trapping holes and radicals generated during the
   photocatalytic degradation process. Subsequently, such photodegradation
   output inferred that this ternary nanocomposite partakes a great
   potential for visible light driven MG and MB photocatalytic degradation.

AB A magnetic Schiff's base chitosan-glutaraldehyde/Fe3O4 composite
   (CHT-GLA/ZnO/Fe3O4) was developed by incorporating zinc oxide (ZnO)
   nanoparticles into its structure to prepare an efficient adsorbent for
   the removal of remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR) dye. The
   CHT-GLA/ZnO/Fe3O4 was characterized by the following methods: CHN, BET,
   FTIR, XRD, SEM-EDX, pHpzc, and potentiometric titrations. Box-Behnken
   design based on response surface methodology was used to optimize the
   effects of the A: ZnO nanoparticles loading (0-50%), B: dose (0.02-0.1
   g), C: pH (4-10), D: temperature (30-60 degrees C), and time E: (10-60
   min) on the synthesis of the magnetic adsorbent and the RBBR dye
   adsorption. The experimental data of kinetics followed the pseudo-second
   order model, while isotherms showed better fit to Freundlich and Temkin
   models. The maximum adsorption capacity of the target nanocomposite
   (CHT-GLA/Fe3O4 containing 25% ZnO or CHT-GLA/ZnO/Fe3O4-25) was reached
   of 176.6 mg/g at 60 degrees C. The adsorption mechanism of RBBR onto
   CHT-GLA/ZnO/Fe3O4 nanocomposite can be attributed to multi-interactions
   including electrostatic attractions, hydrogen bonding, Yoshida
   H-bonding, and n-pi interactions. This study offers a promising hybrid
   nanobiomaterial adsorbent in environmental nanotechnology to separate
   and remove the contaminants such as organic dyes from wastewater.

AB In this work, a novel Ag/AgCl@g-C3N4@UIO-66(NH2) heterojunction was
   constructed for photocatalytic inactivation of Microcystis aeruginosa
   (M. aeruginosa) under visible light. The photocatalyst was synthesized
   by a facile method and characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, XPS, FT-IR,
   UV-vis DRS, PL and EIS. The nano-composite can not only provide lots of
   active sites, but also improve capacities to utilize visible-light
   energy and effectively transfer charge carriers, thus enhancing removal
   efficiencies of cyanobacteria (99.9% chlorophyll a was degraded within
   180 min). Various factors in photodegradation of chlorophyll a were
   studied. Besides, changes on cellular morphologies, membrane
   permeability, physiological activities of M. aeruginosa during
   photocatalysis were investigated. Moreover, the cycle test indicated
   that Ag/AgCl@g-C3N4@UIO-66(NH2) exhibits excellent reusability and
   photocatalytic stability. Finally, a possible mechanism of M. aeruginosa
   inactivation was proposed. In a word, Ag/AgCl@g-C3N4@UIO-66(NH2) can
   efficiently inactivate cyanobacteria under visible light, thus providing
   useful references for further removal of harmful algae in real water
   bodies.

AB For the first time, the zeolite-imidazole (ZIF-67) framework, a new
   subfamily of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), is synthesized on the
   graphene oxide (GO) platform. Co2+ (as a central atom) and
   2-methylimidazole (as organic ligands) were assembled to fabricate
   ZIF-67/GO NPs for providing epoxy-based anti-corrosion coatings with
   both active (self-healing) and passive (barrier) performance. Also, the
   ZIF-67/GO NPs were modified by 3-Aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APS) to
   improve the particles compatibility with the epoxy matrix and control
   their solubility in saline media. The FE-SEM, FT-IR, UV-Vis, Raman, TGA,
   and low-angle XRD techniques were used to prove the successful ZIF-67
   particles growth onto the GO platforms. Tafel (potentiodynamic)
   polarization test demonstrated that the ZIF-67/GO@APS NPs could protect
   the surface of steel through mixed anodic/cathodic type (O-2
   reduction/Fe oxidation) mechanisms and the corrosion current density of
   the iron sample decreased to 1.41 mu A.cm(-2). Interestingly, the epoxy
   coatings containing ZIF-67/GO and ZIF-67/GO@APS particles revealed
   long-term corrosion protection durability and outstanding self-healing
   anti-corrosion performance, which were well studied via EIS, salt spray,
   cathodic delamination, and pull-off techniques. The impedance value at
   the lowest frequency for the coating containing ZIF-67/GO@APS after 50
   days decreased from 10.7 Omega.cm(2) to 10.2 Omega.cm(2) that showed the
   lowest reduction among the studied samples.

AB Antibiotic contamination is increasing scrutinized recently. In this
   work, the AgAgCl/WO3/g-C3N4 (AWC) nanocomposites were successfully
   synthesized using a two-step process involving electrostatic
   self-assembly and in-situ deposition for trimethoprim (TMP) degradation.
   The as-prepared photocatalysts were investigated and characterized by
   XRD, FTIR, XPS, TGA, SEM, TEM, UV-vis, PL and EIS. The experimental
   results indicated that 99.9% of TMP (4 mg/L) was degraded within 60 min
   when the concentration of AWC was 0.5 g/L. Reactive species scavenging
   experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments illustrated
   that superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)) and photogenerated holes
   (h(+)) were the main active species. The functional theory calculation
   and identification of intermediates via HPLC-MS revealed the possible
   degradation pathways of TMP. A double photoelectron-transfer mechanism
   in AWC photocatalyst was proposed. Five cycling photocatalytic tests and
   reactions under different solution matrix effects further supported that
   the AWC was a promising photocatalyst for the removal of TMP from the
   aquatic environment.

AB Efficient visible light photocatalytic elimination of pharmaceutical
   factory wastewater is one of widely concerned and greatly significant
   attempts in dealing with increasingly serious environmental pollution
   problems. In this work, hybrid Ag/AgCl nanoparticles were successfully
   introduced into Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 mesocrystals via precipitation and
   photo-reduction methods for efficient visible light photocatalytic
   antibiotic elimination. Some characterization measurements, such as XRD,
   SEM, TEM, XPS, UV-vis DRS spectra, fluorescence emission spectra,
   time-resolved fluorescence spectra, FT-IR spectra, and electrochemical
   measurements, were applied to investigate the physico-chemical
   properties of nanostructured Ag/AgCl@Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals. The
   experiment results showed that nanostructured Ag/AgCl@Ti3+-TiO2-60
   composites presented the best visible light photocatalytic performance
   for tetracycline degradation, which was approximately 3.52 times of
   Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals and 22.43 times of commercial TiO2. Trapping
   experiments of active species and DMPO spin-trapping ESR experiments
   further confirmed that the visible light photocatalytic tetracycline
   degradation by Ag/AgCl@Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals were mainly due to the
   continuous attacks of photo-generated holes, (OH)-O-center dot and
   O-2(-) radicals on tetracycline molecules. Besides, nanostructured
   Ag/AgCl@Ti3TiO composites were also employed in visible light
   photocatalytic industrial para-ester wastewater degradation. Finally,
   possible tetracycline transformation pathways and visible light
   photocatalytic tetracycline degradation mechanism over plasmonic
   Ag/AgCl@Ti3+-TiO2 composites were also proposed. Current work indicates
   that defective semiconductor mesocrystals and their composites have huge
   prospects in the refractory organic elimination.

AB Novel PSF composite UF membranes incorporating low loadings of
   polydopamine-functionalized graphene oxide particles (rGO-PDA) were
   fabricated and investigated. The functionalization was confirmed using
   FTIR-UATR, Raman spectra, XPS, and SEM. Pristine PSF, PSF/GO, and
   PSF/rGO-PDA MMMs were then prepared using the phase inversion technique
   and analysed using FTIR, SEM, AFM, and contact angle (CA). The
   cross-section SEM images showed better distribution of rGO-PDA particles
   in the pores and polymer wall whereas the pristine GO particles
   aggregate and partially block the pores. Thus, the pure water flux
   increased with the addition of rGO-PDA without affecting the rejection
   properties, while the flux decreased with the embedding of pristine GO
   particles. The highest pure water permeability (PWP) was obtained with
   PSF/rGO-PDA-0.1 to be approximately twice that of the pristine PSF and
   PSF/GO-0.1. All membranes exhibited complete rejection of BSA and HA,
   and showed almost similar performance against different dyes. The FRRs
   of the pristine PSF after three fouling cycles (FRR3) against BSA and HA
   were recorded to be 57.8% and 70.7% respectively. FRR3 was enhanced by
   around 30% with PSF/rGO-PDA composites. The MMMs prepared in this work
   are expected to have great potential on ultrafiltration and similar
   studies on other membrane processes.

AB In this work, sulfide-modified zero-valent iron (S-Fe-0) was used to
   activate periodate (IO4-, PI) for sulfadiazine (SDZ) removal. 60 mu M
   SDZ could be completely removed within only 1 min by S-Fe-0/PI process.
   Compared with other oxidants including H2O2, peroxymonosulfate (PMS),
   peroxydisulfate (PDS), S-Fe-0 activated PI exhibited better performance
   for SDZ removal but with lower Fe leaching. Compared with Fe-0/PI
   process, S-Fe-0/PI process could reduce more than 80% Fe-0 and PI
   dosage. Inorganic ions and nature organic matters had negligible effect
   on SDZ removal in S-Fe-0/PI system inducing its good SDZ removal
   efficiency in natural fresh water. 80.2% SDZ still could be removed
   within 2 min after 7th run. S-Fe-0/PI process also exhibited 2.5 - 20.1
   folds enhancement for various pollutants removal compared with Fe-0/PI
   process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical tests, and density functional theory
   (DFT) calculation were conducted to confirm the presence of sulfurs
   could enhance the reactivity of S-Fe-0 thus increased the efficiency of
   PI activation for antibiotics removal. Electron paramagnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (EPR) tests, radical quenching experiments, quantitative
   detection and DFT calculation were performed to illustrate the role of
   multiple reactive species in SDZ removal and the dominant pathway of
   multiple reactive species production. IO3 center dot , (OH)-O-center
   dot, O-2(-center dot), O-1(2), Fe-IV, and SO4 center dot- all
   participated in SDZ removal. (OH)-O-center dot played the major role in
   SDZ removal and the dominant routine of (OH)-O-center dot production was
   IO4- -> O-2(-center dot) -> H2O2 -> (OH)-O-center dot. Meanwhile,
   S-Fe-0/PI process could effi-ciently mineralize SDZ and reduce the
   toxicity. Comparison with other PI activation approaches and SDZ
   treatment techniques further demonstrated S-Fe-0 was an efficient
   catalyst for PI activation and present study process was a promising
   approach for antibiotics removal.

AB Dielectric ceramic materials with high power density and fast
   charge-discharge speed have attracted increasing attention in recent
   years. However, their mutually restricted energy density and efficiency
   as well as unsatisfactory temperature stability have been the main
   obstacles for their practical applications. Herein, a high recoverable
   energy density of 5.02 Tem(-3) and a high efficiency of similar to 90%
   can be obtained under 422 kV.cm(-1) in the Sr0.85Sm0.1TiO3
   (SST)-modified Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT) ceramics via composition design and
   domain engineering strategy, and the excellent stability of energy
   storage properties in frequency (1-100 Hz) and temperature (20-180
   degrees C) were also observed at 250 kV.cm(-1) in the 0.50NBT-0.50SST
   ceramics, which are attributed to the improved breakdown strength (E-b)
   and the enhanced relaxation behavior. The increased band gap width and
   refined grain size are responsible for the significantly enhanced Eb of
   Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-based solid solution, being confirmed by ultraviolet and
   visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra as well as scanning electron
   microscopy. The generation of polar nanoregions as demonstrated by
   piezoresponse force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy
   results in a negligible remanent polarization and thermally stable
   polarization-field response. It is worth noting that the energy density
   will be further greatly optimized due to the improvement of E-b if this
   ceramic composite is made into multilayer ceramic capacitor as a
   dielectric layer. Moreover, a large power density of 188.6 MW.cm (-3)
   and a fast discharge speed of 70 ns can also be achieved in the
   optimized composition. The results show that the multi-scale
   optimization strategy is an effective way to realize excellent
   comprehensive energy storage performances in the Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 based
   ceramics.

AB Food-grade high internal phase Pickering emulsions (HIPPEs) stabilized
   by protein-based particles have received widespread attention because of
   their potential applications in the food industry. Herein, HIPPEs
   stabilized by sea bass protein (SBP) microgel particles were prepared
   using a simple one-step method. Its internal phase volume fraction was
   as high as 88% oil-in-water emulsion. The impact of SBP microgel
   particles concentration on the physical and chemical properties of
   HIPPEs was investigated. The SBP microgel particles improved the
   environmental stability of HIPPEs. Confocal laser scanning microscope
   (CLSM) and cryo-scanning electron microscope (cryo-SEM) images showed a
   three-dimensional network structure formed around oil droplets through
   SBP microgel particles. The average particles size of the HIPPEs
   droplets decreased with the increased concentration of SBP microgel
   particles. In rheological analysis, as the concentration of SBP microgel
   particles increased, HIPPEs showed higher viscoelasticity, excellent
   recovery, and thixotropy, which further proved the potential application
   of HIPPEs in 3D printing. The physical and chemical stability of
   astaxanthin was improved after encapsulation of HIPPEs. Further, the
   lipolysis degree of HIPPEs and the bioaccessibility of astaxanthin
   during in vitro digestion were improved also by the SBP microgel
   particles. Interestingly, the bioaccessibility of astaxanthin in HIPPEs
   stabilized by 4 wt% SBP microgel particles reached 51.17%.
   Three-dimensional (3D) printing experiments confirmed the extrudability,
   printing performance, and self-supporting properties of HIPPEs. In
   short, the HIPPEs stabilized by SBP microgel particles could be used as
   a delivery vehicle for astaxanthin, and the HIPPEs loaded with
   astaxanthin might have potential as a 3D printing material for edible
   functional foods.

AB Both secondary pollution and the low mechanical strength of adsorbents
   have severely impeded the practical application of adsorption methods in
   the dye wastewater treatment. In this work, we innovatively synthesized
   a composite hydrogel adsorbent by incorporating polydopamine (PDA) and
   montmorillonite (MMT) into the pullulan hydrogel matrix for dye
   adsorption. First, the successful formation of the resultant adsorbents
   was verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning
   electron microscope elemental mapping analysis. Then, several
   physicochemical properties (such as thermal and swelling properties,
   microarchitecture, and mechanical strength) of the five prepared
   adsorbents (PM1-PM5) were investigated. These results de-monstrated the
   adsorbents had tunable properties, which can be achieved by adjusting
   the PDA/MMT mass ratio. Next, the dye adsorption performance was
   systematically explored. The resultant adsorbent (PM3) had a maximum
   adsorption capacity of 112.45 mg/g and its adsorption data was best
   described by a Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic.
   Finally, the adsorption mechanisms and potential commercial
   practicability of the adsorbent were studied. Altogether, the designed
   adsorbent could effectively avoid generating the secondary pollution
   typical of adsorbents and it displayed excellent mechanical strength,
   thus opening up a new horizon in mitigating environmental pollution from
   textile industries.

AB Elimination of toxic dye, one of the utmost and usual industrial
   pollution released in the natural water, is the very serious issue for
   the modern civilization. In this study, a novel bimetallic
   (ZIF-8@ZIF-67) zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have been
   fabricated by a simple and straight forward technique at room
   temperature. So-dalite (SOD) cage type structure, morphology and
   porosity of synthesized bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were
   characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and BET. The results of characterizations
   showed that the ZIF-8@ZIF-67 owns greater nano crystallinity, surface
   area and porosity. As compared to single metallic MOFs (ZIF-67 and
   ZIF-8), the physical and chemical properties of ZIF-8@ZIF-67 were
   improved. Accordingly, the ZIF-8@ZIF-67 potentially analysed for the
   exclusion of rhodamine B from water and the gained outcomes were
   compared with the efficiency of mono-metallic MOFs (ZIF-67 and ZIF-8).
   Several parameters, including initial dye concentrations, sonication
   time, and pH on dye removal efficiency were investigated. Additionally,
   Lang-muir, Freundlich, Tempkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models
   were used to explain the process of adsorption onto the surface of MOFs.
   The results disclosed that the Langmuir model sufficiently explained the
   adsorption procedure as monolayer with higher R-2 values (R-2 = 0.9924,
   0.9822 and 0.9909 of ZIF-67, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@ZIF-67 respectively). The
   mean free energy (E) was observed to be 0.551, 0.576 and 0.532 KJ.mol-1
   for ZIF-67, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@ZIF-67, respectively, exposing that the
   chemisorption dominates the process of adsorption. The qmax premeditated
   with Langmuir model was comparatively high (143.26 mg.g(-1)) as compared
   to ZIF-8 (56.40 mg.g(-1)) and ZIF-67 (81.63 mg.g(-1)), accrediting to
   the intensification in active binding sites. Further, the reusability of
   bimetallic MOFs was tested for four regeneration cycles and results were
   outstanding with only 8 +/- 1% decrease in efficiency. It is assumed
   that, the fabricated ZIF-8@ZIF-67 composite have high applicability for
   the adsorption of toxic dyes from water.

AB The present study aimed at enhancing the adsorption potential of novel
   nanocomposites of Sesbania bispinosa biochar (SBC) with copper oxide
   (SBC/CuO) and manganese oxide nanoparticles (SBC/MnO) for the efficient
   and inexpensive removal of environmentally concerned contaminant arsenic
   (As) from contaminated water at batch scale. The scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, energy
   dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and point of zero charge
   (PZC) analyses proved successful impregnation of the metallic
   nanoparticles on SBC surface. The results revealed the maximum As
   removal (96 %) and adsorption (12.47 mg/g) by SBC/CuO composite at 10 mg
   As/L, optimum pH-4, dose 1.0 g/L and ambient temperature (25 +/- 1.5 C)
   as compared with SBC (7.33 mg/g) and SBC/MnO (7.34 mg/g). Among four
   types of adsorption isotherms, Freundlich isotherm demonstrated best fit
   with R-2 > 0.997. While pseudo second-order kinetic model revealed
   better agreement with kinetic experimental data as matched with other
   kinetic models. The thermodynamic results depicted that As adsorption on
   the as-synthesized adsorbents was endothermic and spontaneous in nature
   with increased randomness. The SBC/CuO displayed excellent reusability
   and stability over four adsorption/desorption cycles and proved that the
   as-synthesized SBC/CuO composite may be the efficient adsorbent for
   practical removal of As from contaminated water.

   underlying causes of its mechanical properties. The present article
   reviews studies that used X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), mercury intrusion measurement (MIP), energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and thermal analysis to investigate the
   microstructure of UHPC containing silica sand and different cementitious
   materials as partial replacement of cement, including silica fume,
   zeolite, ground-granulated blast furnace slags, lithium slag,
   metakaolin, limestone powder, and rice husk ash. Moreover, the
   importance of microstructural analyses for expressing the cause of
   optimal percentages of different cement replacements, determining the
   best type of pozzolan, the appropriate sand in UHPC, and the appropriate
   curing method to create the best mechanical properties were highlighted.
   The results proved the rather small transition zone in the UHPC
   indicating a strong bond between the cement paste and the aggregates,
   and a very dense internal structure.

AB Carbon-bridge-modified malonamide (MLD)/g-C3N4 (CN) was prepared by
   copolymerization of MLD with urea and melamine and loaded with Fe3O4 for
   the high-efficiency removal of tetracycline (TC) in water under
   photo-Fenton. The prepared catalysts were characterized by SEM, TEM, N-2
   adsorption-desorption analysis, XPS, XRD, and FTIR, which proved that
   the modification method successfully introduced the C bridge into the
   carbon nitride molecular system and increased the structural defects of
   the catalyst. The Carbon-bridge-modified MLD/CN/Fe3O4 also had good
   visible-light response and charge-separation and transport abilities in
   the photo-electrochemical test. Degradation results showed that the
   photo-Fenton degradation of TC reached 95.8%, and the mineralization
   rate was 55.7% within 80 min at 80 mM H2O2 dosage, 0.5 g/L catalyst
   dosage, and near-neutral pH by 0.8MLD/CN/Fe3O4. Moreover, the oxidation
   products and mineralization pathways of TC were explored by LC-MS.
   Toxicity analysis indicated low environmental threat of the
   intermediates in TC minerali-zation. EPR analysis and H2O2 decomposition
   efficiency analyses showed an improvement in the H2O2 decom-position
   performance of 0.8MLD/CN/Fe3O4. This work could provide a valuable
   insight for the application of heterogeneous photo-Fenton technology in
   wastewater treatment.

AB In ultrasonic (US) processes, the development of environmentally
   friendly, effective, low-cost, and durable catalysts is needed to
   degrade pollutants. Here, ZnFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) was doped
   with vanadium (V) for the sonocatalytic degradation of a pesticide
   pymetrozine. The resulting catalyst had an average thickness of 25 nm, a
   specific surface area of 125.38 m(2)/g, and a bandgap value of 2.20 eV.
   In 90 min ultrasonic treatment, V-doped ZnFe LDH had 73% pymetrozine
   removal efficiency, which was 32% more than that of undoped ZnFe LDH.
   The US/V-doped ZnFe LDH process had a strong synergistic effect (synergy
   factor 7.17), which resulted in 57% and 68% greater efficiencies than
   the US alone and V-doped ZnFe LDH alone, respectively. The role of
   radical oxygen species was confirmed by carrying out radical trapping
   experiments using different scavengers and electron paramagnetic
   resonance analyses. Due to its high stability, the catalyst had good
   reuse potential with only an 8% performance reduction after 5 reuse
   cycles. Besides, the leaching of heavy metals was insignificant owing to
   the high integrity of the catalyst as confirmed by SEM and X-ray
   diffraction analysis. According to the GC-MS analysis, pymetrozine was
   first transformed into cyclic compounds then into aliphatic compounds
   such as animated products and carboxylic acids.

AB In the present study, glutaraldehyde was used as a hydrophobic modifier
   to crosslink polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and copper ion was immobilized by
   sodium alginate (SA). Polyvinyl alcohol-copper alginate (PVA-CA) gel
   beads were prepared by a one-step process, and were used to adsorb and
   remove tetracycline (TC) from an aqueous solution. The beads were
   characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric
   analysis (TGA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement, X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The adsorption experiment showed
   that the optimal pH value of the beads was 5, and that their adsorption
   met pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isothermal models. The
   adsorption thermodynamics experiment showed that the adsorption process
   was spontaneous and endothermic. Under optimal adsorption conditions,
   the maximum adsorption capacity for TC of the beads was 231.431 mg/g,
   which was much higher than that of a single copper alginate matrix.
   After 5 adsorption desorption cycles, the adsorption capacity remained
   high. FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the
   cation bonding bridge reaction was the main driving force behind the
   adsorption mechanism. Compared with other reported adsorption materials,
   the PVA-CA gel beads have high adsorption capacity, a simple preparation
   process, and excellent recovery performance.

   microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scat -tering (DLS) revealed that the
   green synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles are spherical and have a
   mean particle size of 88 nm, with a negative zeta potential of-16.9 mV.
   The XRD graph showed the crystalline and monoclinic phases of CuO
   nanoparticles. The average crystalline size around 85.80 nm was observed
   by the Debye-Scherrer formula. The adsorption characteristics of the
   nano-adsorbents were investigated using methyl orange, and the
   adsorption efficiency at room tem-perature attained 95 mg/g. Copper
   oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) adsorb methyl orange dye most effectively
   at pH 4.5 when the dye is applied in quantities of 0.04 g/50 mL.
   Box-Behnken design (BBD) in response surface methodology (RSM) was used
   to optimize various process parameters, such as pH solution (X-1: 2 -
   11), adsorbing dose (X-2: 0.01 - 0.08 g/L), [MO] dye concentration (X-3:
   10 - 80 mg/L). Overall, the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2)
   value of 0.99 demonstrated that the used model was quite appropriate,
   and the chosen RSM was effective in optimization the decolorization
   conditions of MO.

AB Sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) were prepared and embedded in calcium
   cross-linked alginate films in varying concentration, and their effect
   on the functional properties of the films were studied. The FE-SEM image
   showed uniform dispersion of up to 2 wt% of SNPs, above which
   aggregation was observed. The addition of 2 wt% of SNPs showed the best
   results of the tensile and water vapor barrier properties, with an
   increase in 12% and 41%, respectively. The surface color of the films
   changed significantly by the addition of SNPs with a decrease in
   transparency. However, the UV barrier properties showed a considerable
   increase of 99%. In addition, the incorporation of SNPs increased the
   hydrophobicity of the film, which was evident by the increased water
   contact angle and decreased moisture content of the film, as indicated
   by the thermal analysis results. The antimicrobial activity of
   alginate/SNPs composite film was tested against foodborne pathogenic
   bacteria, E. coli and L. monocytogenes. The nanocomposite film did not
   completely destroy E. coli but showed a bacteriostatic activity to
   reduce the 60% of bacterial colonies. However, the activity against L.
   monocytogenes was found to be highly bactericidal at the highest
   nanoparticle concentration, where a 100% bacterial elimination was
   observed after 12 h of exposure. Thus, the alginate/SNPs composite film
   can be used for the packaging of frozen foods with high moisture content
   that are susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes contamination, such as
   meat products.

AB The current work concentrated on the green synthesis of silver

   extract, optimizing the different experimental factors required for the
   formation and stability of AgNPs. The preparation of nanoparticles was
   confirmed by the observation of the color change of the mixture of
   silver nitrate, after the addition of the plant extract, from yellow to
   a reddish-brown colloidal suspension and was established by detecting
   the surface plasmon resonance band at 535.5 nm, utilizing UV-Visible
   analysis. The optimum conditions were found to be 1 mM of silver nitrate
   concentration, a 1:9 ratio extract of the mixture, and a 4 h incubation
   period. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum indicated that
   the phytochemicals compounds present in Citrus limon zest extract had a
   fundamental effect on the production of AgNPs as a bio-reducing agent.
   The morphology, size, and elemental composition of AgNPs were
   investigated by zeta potential (ZP), dynamic light scattering (DLS),
   SEM, EDX, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM) analysis, which showed crystalline spherical silver nanoparticles.
   In addition, the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of this
   bioactive silver nanoparticle were also investigated. The AgNPs showed
   excellent antibacterial activity against one Gram-negative pathogens
   bacteria, Escherichia coli, and one Gram-positive bacteria,
   Staphylococcus aureus, as well as antifungal activity against Candida
   albicans. The obtained results indicate that the antioxidant activity of
   this nanoparticle is significant. This bioactive silver nanoparticle can
   be used in biomedical and pharmacological fields.

AB Recent advancements in green and innovative technologies have resulted
   in a number of innovations in manufacturing operations to accelerate
   sustainable development (SD). Despite several benefits of green
   innovation adoption (GIA), the adoption rate of these initiatives is
   still abysmal in manufacturing organisations. To fill this gap, we have
   developed and validated the GIA model grounded on the unified theory of
   acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), which compels organisations to
   implement these novel technologies. Data was collected through a survey
   of 516 respondents from Pakistani manufacturing industries and analysed
   using structural equation modelling (SEM) and the artificial neural
   network (ANN) approach. The deliverables of SEM and ANN approaches
   demonstrated that all green integrated constructs of the research model,
   such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation,
   social influence, facilitating conditions, and innovation cost, predict
   green behavioural intention (GBI). Besides, GBI was found to have a
   strong direct and mediating effect among integrated constructs towards
   GIA. In addition, the moderation of organisational size highlighted the
   differentiation among small, medium and large size enterprises.
   Additionally, ANN specifies the robustness and relative importance of
   all integrated constructs, whereas green facilitating conditions have
   the highest relative importance value for GIA. The proposed integrated
   model offers novel insights for decision-makers and suggests various

AB Metaverse (MS) is a digital universe accessible through a virtual
   environment. It is established through the merging of virtually improved
   physical and digital reality. Metaverse (MS) offers enhanced immersive
   experiences and a more interactive learning experience for students in
   learning and educational settings. It is an expanded and synchronous
   communication setting that allows different users to share their
   experiences. The present study aims to evaluate students' perception of
   the application of MS in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for
   medical-educational purposes. In this study, 1858 university students
   were surveyed to examine this model. The study's conceptual framework
   consisted of adoption constructs including Technology Acceptance Model
   (TAM), Personal innovativeness (PI), Perceived Compatibility (PCO), User
   Satisfaction (US), Perceived Triability (PTR), and Perceived
   Observability (POB). The study was unique because the model correlated
   technology-based features and individual-based features. The study also
   used hybrid analyses such as Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and
   Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The present study also employs the
   Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) to assess the importance and
   performance factors. The study finds US as an essential determinant of
   users' intention to use the metaverse (UMS). The present study's finding
   is useful for stakeholders in the educational sector in understanding
   the importance of each factor and in making plans based on the order of
   significance of each factor. The study also methodologically contributes
   to Information Systems (IS) literature because it is one of the few
   studies that have used a complementary multi-analytical approach such as
   ML algorithms to investigate the UMS metaverse systems.

AB Na2SO4 (NS)-activated slag as a kind of alkali-activated slag (AAS) had
   great development potential in low carbon cementitious materials field,
   because NS could be obtained from natural resources with much lower CO2
   emissions than NaOH and water glass. However, the main issue was its
   slower strength development at both early and later ages. With intention
   to mitigate this problem, ultra-fine slag was used, and the increased
   CO2 emissions caused by ultra-fine slag expected to be balanced by the
   use of fly ash (FA). In the present study, NS-activated ultra-fine
   slag/FA was designed. Effects of NS dosage and FA content on the
   compressive strength were researched, and the activated process was
   assessed by chemical shrinkage, XRD, TGA, pH value, ion concentration,
   NMR, and SEM. Finally, CO2 emissions were evaluated. Results showed that
   compressive strength of slag with D50 = 3.1 mu m activated by 4% Na2O-E
   of NS reached 36.2 MPa and 77.3 MPa at 28 d and 90 d age. The main
   hydrates of NS-activated slag were ettringite and C-(N)-S-H. Moreover,
   in the NS-activated ultra-fine slag/FA mortars, 20% FA significantly
   reduced the 3 d compressive strength, but slightly increased the 28 d
   compressive strength. CO2 emissions of this blend seemed much lower than
   that of NaOH or water glass-activated slag. These results suggested one
   alkali-activated binder with low carbon emissions. (C) 2020 Elsevier

AB This study aimed to develop intelligent packaging films possessing
   pH-sensitive and mechanical stability for cassava starch-based
   substrates using red cabbage extracts by a simple casting technique. It
   also investigated the effect of native and different dual-modified
   [oxidized hydroxypropyl starch, acetylated distarch phosphate (ADSP),
   and oxidized-acetylated starch] cassava starches on the morphological,
   physical, and pH-sensitive properties of intelligent films.
   Dual-modified cassava starch films presented better transparency,
   waterresistance, water vapor barrier ability and tensile strength than
   native cassava starch films. Scanning electron microscopy observation
   revealed the compactness of the films was improved by the modification.
   The addition of new groups was confirmed after the dual-modification of
   cassava starch in the films by infrared spectroscopy. The ADSP films had
   the best thermal stability compared to the other three films. Notably,
   all films produced intense naked-eye detectable colorimetric response to
   pH variation (2-12) and volatile ammonia, and exhibited different color
   reversibility properties. Anionic cassava starch formed stable complexes
   with anthocyanins through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen
   bonding, thus enhancing the stability of anthocyanins. Therefore,
   cassava starch-based films have promising potential for applications in
   intelligent food packaging.

AB The development of efficient and reusable catalysts is desired to
   improve biodiesel production process. For this purpose, the magnetic
   Fe3O4/ZIF-8 composites were first prepared by incorporating ZIF-8 MOF
   into Fe3O4 nanoparticles through in-situ approach, and then a
   vanadium-substituted heteropolyacid (HPA), H6PV3MoW8O40, was
   encapsulated in the support to afford the solid catalyst. The
   so-prepared catalysts were characterized by using XRD, FT-IR, TEM, SEM,
   TG, VSM, and nitrogen porosimetry measurement. Results revealed that the
   Fe3O4/ZIF-8 support was really formed, and the HPAs had been loaded on
   the magnetic composite. The catalytic performances of the developed
   catalysts were evaluated for the heterogeneous biodiesel production from
   the low-quantity oils. This catalyst had good magnetic responsiveness,
   and could catalyze the transesterification of soybean oil and
   esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) simultaneously, thus achieving
   one-step transformation of triglycerides and FFAs to biodiesel in a
   heterogeneous manner. The transesterification conversion obtained was
   92.6% with 30:1 methanol/ oil molar ratio at a catalyst loading of 6 wt%
   and reaction temperature of 160 degrees C for 10 h. Moreover, the solid
   catalyst could be recycled by an external magnet, and displayed a good
   reusability with a minimal mass loss and a slight decrease in the
   activity after reuse for five runs. This protocol showed great potential
   for sustainable biodiesel production from the low-quantity oils due to
   the pronounced activity and good reusability of the solid catalyst. (c)

   products. XRD confirmed that the synthesized geopolymer/zeolite products
   are geopolymer/zeolite A (has a crystallite size of 58.44 nm &
   abbreviated as G1) and geopolymer/faujasite (has a crystallite size of
   25.58 and 20.26 nm & abbreviated as G2 and G3, respectively). Also, the
   synthesized zeolite products are sodium aluminum silicate hydrate (has a
   crystallite size of 27.65 and 41.85 nm & abbreviated as H1 and H2,
   respectively). Besides, the synthesized zeolite/zeolite product is
   sodium aluminum silicate hydrate/zeolite A (has a crystallite size of

AB Xylene is a toxic carcinogen, which may irritate eyes and respiratory
   tract, or damage the central nervous system. However, the traditional
   semiconductor gas sensor can only detect the ppm level of xylene gas,
   which cannot meet the building air quality monitoring requirements.
   Therefore, the development of low concentration gas detection of xylene
   gas sensor is necessary. In this article, a one-step hydrothermal method
   for the preparation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Co3O4 nanocomposite
   was reported. Then, rGO/Co3O4 nanocomposites were characterized by
   various characterization methods. It was found that the structure of
   cobalt tetroxide (Co3O4) nanoparticle-coated rGO nanosheets was
   successfully synthesized. Specific internal morphology could be seen by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM). Then the gas sensor made of rGO/Co3O4 nanocomposite material was
   tested for its gas sensitivity performance. A series of properties such
   as repeatability and stability of the material were tested. According to
   the test results, the sensitivity of 1rGO/Co3O4 (335 wt%) to xylene gas
   was better than that of 2rGO/Co3O4 (5.54 wt%) and pure Co3O4, and the
   optimal working temperature of rGO/Co 3 0 4 to 50 ppm xylene was 175
   degrees C, which was 50 degrees C lower than that of pure Co3O4. In
   addition, the rCO/Co3O4 gas sensor could also detect xylene gas with a
   minimum concentration of 1 pph. Finally, the gas sensing mechanism of
   the gas sensor for xylene gas was analyzed.

AB The beneficial or deleterious effects of nanomedicines emerge from their
   complex interactions with intracellular pathways and their subcellular
   fate. Moreover, the dynamic nature of plasma membrane accounts for the
   movement of these nanocarriers within the cell towards different
   organelles thereby not only influencing their pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic properties but also bioavailability, therapeutic
   efficacy and toxicity. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of
   underlying parameters controlling nanocarrier endocytosis and
   intracellular fate is essential. In order to direct nanoparticles
   towards specific sub-cellular organelles the physicochemical attributes
   of nanocarriers can be manipulated. These include particle size, shape
   and surface charge/chemistry. Restricting the particle size of
   nanocarriers below 200 nm contributes to internalization via clathrin
   and caveolae mediated pathways. Similarly, a moderate negative surface
   potential confers endolysosomal escape and targeting towards
   mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. This review aims to
   provide an insight into these physicochemical attributes of nanocarriers
   fabricated using amphiphilic graft copolymers affecting cellular
   internalization. Fundamental principles understood from experimental
   studies have been extrapolated to draw a general conclusion for the
   designing of optimized nanoparticulate drug delivery systems and
   enhanced intracellular uptake via specific endocytic pathway. (C) 2021

AB Green synthesis ultrasonic method is reported for the preparation of
   zinc oxide nanoparticles loaded on activated carbon (AC) derived from
   coffee waste. The zinc modified AC was used effectively for the
   elimination of malachite green (MG) from wastewater. The examined batch
   adsorption parameters are; initial pH (2-9), adsorbent dose (0.10-0.50
   g/100 mL), mixing time (5-120 min), MG concentrations (25-300 mg/L) and
   temperature (298-318 K). XRD, SEM/EDS, FT-IR and TGA/DTA techniques were
   used to characterize the developed Zn(OH)(2)-AC composite. The results
   demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of Zn(OH)(2)-AC composite was
   improved with incremental of the initial dye concentration, pH, and
   temperature, and decreased as the Zn(OH)(2)-AC composite dose was
   increased. The Langmuir isotherm model (R-2 = 0.97) showed better
   conventionality than the Freundlich model (R-2 = 0.80) with a maximum
   removal capacity of 303.03 mg/g at 318 K and pH 7.0. The kinetic results
   revealed that the equilibrium data well follow the pseudo-second-order
   model. The thermodynamic investigations indicated the spontaneous and
   endothermic removal of MG. The cycling test exhibited that the developed
   Zn(OH)(2)-AC composite had virtuous repeatable adsorption/desorption
   performance particularly until the fourth cycle. In addition to
   comparatively shorter adsorption time, relatively high adsorption
   capacity, reasonable reuse performance, and being of cost-effective and
   eco-friendly of the developed Zn(OH)(2)-AC composite make it economic,
   effective and hopeful adsorbent for cleaning MG containing wastewaters.

AB Pharmaceutical products and dyes are the main environmental pollutants
   in the effluent of textile, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.
   Therefore, in this study, the central composite design (CCD) based on
   the response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the
   operating parameters and determine the optimal conditions for the
   removal of enrofloxacin (ENF) and Rhodamine B (RhB) by graphene oxide
   (GO). The structure and morphology of GO were studied using scanning
   electron microscopes (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques.
   Quadratic model was confirmed to describe each of the removal efficiency
   responses (%R) a with high correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.9987 for ENF
   and R-2 = 0.9999 for RhB) (R-2-Adj = 0.9963 for ENF and R-2-Adj = 0.9991
   for RhB). In optimal conditions, RhB concentration of 10 mg L-1,
   adsorbent amount of 0.24 g, sonication time of 23 min, ENF concentration
   of 10 mg L-1, and pH 7, removal rates of more than 92.5% were obtained
   for both analytes. Adsorption equilibrium was studied with Langmuir,
   Freundlich, Langmuir-Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, Toth and Khan
   isotherm models. Equilibrium data were best fitted with the
   Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model. Maximum adsorption capacity of ENF
   and RhB on GO were 45.035 mg g(-1) and 107.230 mg g(-1), respectively.
   The recyclability of GO was evaluated during the ENF and RhB adsorption
   process. The results showed that up to 4 cycles of adsorbent, the
   adsorption efficiency is reduced by a tiny amount. The present study
   showed that GO is highly effective in removing ENF and RhB from
   environmental water samples.

AB Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) provides an attractive
   alternative to anthraquinone process for H2O2 synthesis. Rational design
   of earth-abundant electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis via a two-electron
   ORR process in acids is attractive but still very challenging. In this
   work, we report that nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes as a
   multi-functional support for CoSe2 nanoparticles not only keep CoSe2
   nanoparticles well dispersed but alter the crystal structure, which in
   turn improves the overall catalytic behaviors and thereby renders high
   O-2-to-H2O2 conversion efficiency. In 0.1 M HClO4, such CoSe2@NCNTs
   hybrid delivers a high H2O2 selectivity of 93.2% and a large H2O2 yield
   rate of 172 ppm center dot h(-1) with excellent durability up to 24 h.
   Moreover, CoSe2@NCNTs performs effectively for organic dye degradation
   via electro-Fenton process.

   water was executed by using chitin-cl-poly (itaconic
   acid-co-acrylamide)/zirconium tungstate nanocomposite hydrogel
   (Ch-cl-poly(IA-co-AAm)-ZrW NCH). The Ch-cl-poly(IA-co-AAm)-ZrW NCH was
   fabricated proficiently by microwave-induced sol-gel/copolymrization
   method. The zirconium tungstate (ZrW) photocatalyst was prepared by
   co-precipitation method using sodium tungstate and zirconium oxychloride
   in ratio (2:1). The polymeric hydrogel part has been used to support the
   ZrW, and it acted as an adsorbent for adsorptive removal of FSB dye. The
   band gap for nanocomposite hydrogel was found about 4.18 eV by using
   Tauc equation. The Ch-cl-poly(IA-co-AAm)-ZrW NCH was characterized by
   various techniques as FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy),
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmittance electron microscopy (TEM), energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM). The adsorptional-photocatalytic remediation experiment of FSB dye
   was optimized for reaction parameters as FSB dye and
   Ch-cl-poly(IA-co-AAm)-ZrW NCH concentration, and pH. The maximum
   percentage removal for FSB dye was observed at 92.66% in 120 min under

   potentiodynamic polarization and weight loss measurements, respectively.
   The adsorption process of AT on carbon steel surface was found to obey
   Langmuir adsorption isotherm with the highest K-ads value 476,190 M-1 at

   for further investigations about the nature of the interaction between
   the molecules of AT (both of its tautomers) and metal surface. SEM and

AB In the present paper, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was
   evaluated for optimizing the Hexavalent Chromium (Cr (VI)) removal
   efficiency using our synthesized adsorbent, i.e., Fe3O4-NPs loaded on
   activated carbon (AC-Fe3O4-NPs). For studying the characteristics of
   synthesized catalyst, the different analyses, e.g., pHpzc, XRD, FE-SEM,
   and VSM was utilized. As detected in results, a suitable correlation
   could be perceived between the values obtained by experiments and the
   values predicted by the quadratic model (P 0.05). Results revealed that
   the efficiency of Cr (VI) adsorption decreases by an increase in pH
   values and an increase in the reaction time and adsorbent dosage was led
   to development of the process efficiency. Through employment of analysis
   of variance (ANOVA) for comparing acquired data, the optimum conditions
   was proposed; these conditions were pH of 3, pollutant concentration of
   40 mg/L, the adsorbent concentration of 1 g/L, and time of 90. At these
   determined conditions, Cr (VI) adsorption efficiency was higher than
   21.90 %. The Cr (VI) adsorption experimental data were superlatively
   fitted to the Freundlich isotherm model and the removal followed the
   pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R2 0.99). The experimentally obtained
   maximum adsorption capacity of AC-Fe3O4-NPs for Cr (VI) adsorption was
   estimated to be 15.24 mg/g.

AB In this study, the reaction between sulfidated nanoscale zero-valent
   iron (S-nZVI) and heavy metal cations as well as the role of sulfur were
   investigated. The results showed the corrosion products of S-nZVI were
   lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH) or/and magnetite (Fe3O4), depending on heavy
   metal species. While the removal of Hg(II), Ag(I), Cu (II), and Pb(II)
   by S-nZVI was rapid and could achieve over 99% within 5 mins, the
   removal of Ni(II) and Zn(II) was low in efficiency and unstable. Sulfur
   was existed as iron sulfides at fresh S-nZVI, but was displaced by the
   heavy metals and formed the related sulfide compound, or oxidized to S-0
   and SO42-. The removal mechanisms are strongly dependent on the
   solubility product constant (K-sp) of metal sulfides. For Hg(II) and
   Ag(I), with K-sp of corresponding metal sulfides much lower than that of
   iron sulfide, the removal mechanism is the displacement reaction. For
   Cu(II) and Pb(II), with K-sp of corresponding metal sulfides moderately
   lower than that of iron sulfide, the removal mechanisms are the
   displacement reaction and complexation with surface groups of S-nZVI.
   For Zn(II) and Ni(II), whose K-sp of corresponding metal sulfides
   slightly lower than that of iron sulfide, are mainly removed by
   complexation with surface groups of S-nZVI.

AB Laser-directed energy deposition (LDED) provides an attractive and
   cost-effective way to remanufacture high- value engineering components.
   However, the LDED manufactured (LDEDed) components are usually
   charac-terized by large columnar grains along the deposition direction,
   leading to mechanical anisotropy. Meanwhile, higher performance is
   usually required in the damaged regions. In this paper, the effects of
   interlayer laser shock peening (LSP) treatment, namely, an innovative
   laser hybrid additive manufacturing technology combined LDED with LSP,
   on microstructural evolution and mechanical performance of Ti6Al4V alloy
   were investigated. Particularly, the microstructural features between
   adjacent deposited layers were clarified using scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   observations. The results indicated that the epitaxial growth of
   columnar grains caused by LDED was inhibited, and fine equiaxed grains
   were formed between deposited layers due to the recrystallization
   behavior. Besides, the microhardness and tensile property of the LDEDed
   specimen were significantly improved by the interlayer LSP treatment.
   Consequently, the laser hybrid additive manufacturing -generated
   dominant mechanism of the microstructural evolution and tensile property
   enhancement was revealed.

AB Chloride ion (Cl-) widely presents in natural water and wastewater,
   which can significantly affect the performance of sulfate radical-based
   advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs). However, few studies are
   available now on the generation of chlorinated by-products in the
   peroxymonosulfate (PMS) based systems. Here a novel catalyst
   (cobalt/carbon nanotubes, Co/CNTs) was synthesized and used as a PMS
   activator to remove methylparaben (MeP) with and without Cl-. The
   morphology and chemical composition of the fresh and used Co/CNTs were
   characterized by TEM, SEM, XRD, BET, and XPS. Results revealed that
   Co/CNTs exhibited significant catalytic activity toward MeP removal, and
   the removal efficiency increased with the augment of reaction
   temperature and concentrations of Co/CNTs and PMS. In the absence of CI
   83.2% of 10 mu M MeP was degraded within 60 mM by using 2 mg/L Co/CNTs
   and 100 mu M PMS at 25 degrees C with pH 7.0. However, complete removal
   of MeP was achieved within 20 mM in the presence of 100 mM Cl-, which
   enhanced the apparent rate constant by a factor of 4.3. Consequently,
   TOC removal was enhanced from 8.1% to 19.2% within 60 mM. Through the
   quenching experiments, both SO4 center dot- and center dot OH were found
   responsible for MeP degradation without Cl-, while Cl-2(-center dot) was
   the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) with 100 mM Cl-. Based on the
   intermediates identified via TOF-LCMS, four potential reaction pathways
   were proposed, including hydrogen abstraction coupling reaction,
   hydroxylation, center dot OH attack, and Cl-2(-center dot) attack. The
   intermediates also exhibited decreased toxicity compared to the parent
   compound based on the ecotoxicity evaluation. In addition, Co/CNTs + PMS
   system achieved over 60% MeP removal from real wastewater with elevated
   PMS concentration, indicating the process applicability. These findings
   provide valuable information of SR-AOPs to facilitate organic
   contaminants removal in Cl--containing water.

AB To alleviate the secondary risks of using metal-organic frameworks
   (MOFs) nanoparticles as adsorbent, a novel method of loading two MOFs
   (ZIF-8 or UiO66-NH2) on the carbon nanotube aerogels (MPCA) by in situ
   nucleation and growth of MOFs nanoparticles onto carbon nanotubes were
   developed. The prepared MOFs@MPCA aerogels were well characterized via
   SEM, TEM, EDS, FT-IR, XRD and XPS to reveal the microstructure and
   formation mechanism of MOF@MPCA. Besides, the hydrophilia, mechanical
   property and thermostability of MOF@MPCA were investigated. The results
   showed that MOF@MPCA had good hydrophilia, compression resilience and
   thermostability. The study on the ability to adsorb herbicides (chipton
   and alachlor) showed that the adsorption capacity of MOF@MPCA was
   stronger compared with single MOFs nanoparticles, which indicated that
   there was a synergistic effect between MOFs and MPCA. The equilibrium
   adsorption capacity of chipton adsorbed by UiO66-NH2@MPCA was 227.3
   mg/g, and can be expediently reused for 5 cycles without a significant
   decrease in adsorption performance. Moreover, the results of biosafety
   experiments showed that MPCA can reduce the risk of MOFs nanoparticles
   leakage into the environment and accumulation in organisms. This work
   can provide a new research idea, which has potential applications to
   remove pollutants effectively and safely from the environment.

   Experiment and theoretical calculations data show that PESLE can

   results demonstrate that the PESLE is 800 mg/L, its anti-corrosion
   nature can reach about 96%. And with the augment of temperature, the
   anti-corrosion capacity of PESLE can still reach about 95% at a

   is adsorbed onto the copper interface, the copper sample is effectively

   results directly prove that PESLE efficaciously restrain the corrosion
   of Cu in H2SO4 environment. XPS test results show that PESLE adsorption
   onto the Cu interface can detect Cu-N bond, which proves that chemical
   adsorption occurs. Quantum chemistry calculation data manifest that the
   three components of PESLE can reveal high anti-corrosion property.
   Molecular dynamics simulation data manifest the three components of
   PESLE can be adsorbed at the Cu (111) surface with paralleled way, and
   can have a large binding energy.

AB An ideal adsorbent should possess the ability of being easily
   fabricated, cheap to produce, and have a high adsorptive capacity for
   adsorbates. Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), a moderately new member of
   the carbonaceous family of adsorbents, has arisen as a potential
   adsorbent because of its distinct features such as high BET surface
   area, large pore size and porosity volume, tunable surface chemistry and
   thermo-mechanical stability. In this review paper, we have presented a
   systematic documentation of all the research efforts on OMC preparation,
   modification, characterization, and environmental application for
   pollutant removal. The subsequent characterizations of OMC employing
   different techniques, such as, N-2 Adsorption-Desorption Isotherm,
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope
   (TEM) images, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS)
   spectra, are summarized. Furthermore, we have compared the adsorption
   performance of different modified OMCs towards different inorganic
   pollutants, such as heavy metals, and various organic pollutants
   categorically, such as dyes, phenols and their derivatives, volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs), alkaloids, nitrogen containing organic
   compounds, and vitamins. Future research directions on functionalized
   OMC for the adsorptive removal of emerging pollutants and other
   environmental applications are also provided.

AB Zinc oxide (ZnO) based nanostructures have gained remarkable attention
   worldwide for their photocatalytic activation behavior as a
   semi-conductor metal oxide photocatalyst in different industries, i.e.
   paints, cosmetic, rubber and composites coating. The main motivation of
   this thematic review is to analyze the mechanism of photocatalytic
   activity of ZnO nanostructures (ZONSs) in detail, and their application
   in photovoltaic, biomedical and sensing fields based on photocatalytic
   performance and other crucial properties that enable nano ZnO as a
   potential and competitive candidate in commercial markets. ZONSs were
   characterized with a wide range of analytical tools including X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), electron microscopies (SEM, FESEM, TEM), dynamic
   light scattering (DLS) and UV-VIS spectroscopy etc. These
   characterization tools provide us typical information about the crystal
   structure, level of crystallinity, shape, size, dimension and the change
   in physical, optical and chemical properties of ZONSs. Synthesis routes,
   process variables and their combined effect on the performance
   characterization of ZONSs have also been discussed in detail. The aim of
   this review is to provide an up-to-date knowledge to the readers about
   the applications of nano ZnO in diverse industries either in catalytic
   or in sensing form.

AB Microcracks initiated and propagated behaviors in Al/steel interface
   determined interfacial bonding strength and this was observed by in situ
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technology. Interface with-out or
   with discontinuous intermetallic compound (IMC) had low bonding strength
   owing to insufficient metallurgical bonding. When interface was joined
   with 2-3 lm serration-shaped s5-Fe1.8Al7.2Si, largest bonding strength
   of 205 MPa was obtained. Microcracks initiated at protrusion of
   s5-Fe1.8Al7.2Si and then propagated to s5-Fe1.8Al7.2Si layer and
   s5-Fe1.8Al7.2Si/Al interface. When interface was joined with 3- 5 lm
   h-Fe(Al,Si)3 + s5-Fe1.8Al7.2Si, microcracks initiated at root of IMC
   layers and the interfacial bonding strength was 150 MPa. When interface
   was joined with 5-10 lm h-Fe(Al,Si)3 + s5-Fe1.8Al7.2Si, microc-racks
   initiated and propagated along IMC layer. Lower interfacial bonding
   strength (106 MPa) was pro-duced owing to large lattice mismatch between
   h-Fe(Al,Si)3 and s5-Fe1.8Al7.2Si, microdefects and higher residual
   stress. When interface was joined with 10 lm g-Fe2(Al,Si)5 +
   h-Fe(Al,Si)3 + s5- Fe1.8Al7.2Si, microcracks initiated and propagated
   along g-Fe2(Al,Si)5 layer or steel/g-Fe2(Al,Si)5 inter-face. Lowest
   bonding strength (64 MPa) was obtained resulted from pre-generated
   microcracks in g- Fe2(Al,Si)5 layer, largest residual stress, crystal
   defects and abnormal aggregation of Si. (c) 2022 Harbin Institute of

   oxide (Ag/ZIF-67@GO), and its catalytic performance was studied for the
   heterogeneous activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) under visible-light.
   The catalyst surface morphology and structure were analyzed by FT-IR,
   XRD, XPS, DRS, FE-SEM, EDX, TEM, BET, ICP-AES and TGA analysis. The
   efficacy of PMS activation by the Ag/ZIF-67@GO under visible light was
   assessed by phenol degradation and E. coli inactivation. Phenol was
   completely degraded within 30 min by HO center dot, SO4 center dot- and
   O-2(center dot-) generated through the photocatalytic PMS activation. In
   addition, total E. coli inactivation was attained in 15 min that
   confirmed the highly efficient catalytic activation of PMS by the
   as-made nanocomposite under visible light. The reaction mechanism was
   elucidated and the importance of the generated reactive species followed
   the order of: HO center dot > SO4 center dot- > O-2(center dot-) > h(+),
   implying a radical-pathway dominated process.

AB In this study, spinel CuCo2O4 (CCO) with a hierarchical hollow sphere
   morphology was encapsulated in V2O5 decorated ultra-wrinkled graphitic
   carbon-nitride (VO-UCN) for the first time via a facile
   glycerol-assisted solvothermal method in the interest of developing a
   novel high-efficiency double Z-type nano-photocatalyst (denoted as
   VO-UCN@CCO). The remarkable physicochemical features of the as-prepared
   nano-photocatalysts were verified using diverse characterization
   techniques including TGA, XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, TEM, BET, UV-vis DRS, PL,
   EIS, and transient photocurrent techniques. Herein, VO-UCN@CCO
   nanocomposite was employed for the photodisintegration of levofloxacin
   (LVOF) antibiotic under visible-light irradiation and the impact of
   certain operative reaction system variables was explored in an effort to
   optimize the photocatalytic capability. The 40% loading of CCO in
   VO-UCN@CCO nanocomposite was found to display maximum photocatalytic
   performance (about 95%) for LVOF photodecomposition, which was 9.3, 6.6,
   and 13.8 times greater when compared with pristine VO, UCN, and CCO,
   respectively. A high capability was observed for as-prepared
   photocatalyst during reusability tests and near 90% degradation
   efficiency was obtained in the sixth run. The complete mineralization of
   LVOF was achieved by the VO-UCN@CCO photocatalyst process after 300 min
   of reaction. An excellent synergy factor towards the degradation of LVOF
   was obtained for VO-UCN@CCO compared to each of its components alone.
   This peculiar design is envisaged to provide new inspirations for
   ameliorating the photocatalytic decontamination of tenacious and
   non-biodegradable species present in real wastewater.

AB Zein as a kind of carrier material has attracted extensive interest,
   while the interaction mechanism between zein and nutrients is still
   elusive. In this work, the binding mechanism of zein with
   epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was investigated via
   multi-spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The quenching
   of zein by EGCG is mainly static quenching, and the secondary structure
   of zein is slightly changed after the binding of EGCG to zein. The
   formation of Zein-EGCG complexes was confirmed by ultraviolet-visible
   (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation clarified that the
   EGCG prefers to bind to the pocket of zein formed by residues Y171,
   Q174, L176 and L205. Electrostatic and van der Waals interactions played
   a dominant role for the binding of EGCG to zein, which was consistent
   with the results by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and
   thermodynamic analysis. This study provides new insights into the
   interaction mechanism between zein and EGCG, which is very important to
   develop plant protein as tea polyphenol delivery system.

AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is an emerging contaminant, has
   received extensive attention in recent times due to its high toxicity
   and environmental risk. In this study, BiOI supported on Zn-Al
   hydrotalcite (BOI0.04-BHZA) was calcined at 400 degrees C to obtain
   flower-shaped Bi5O2I/ZnO n-n heterojunction microspheres for the
   photocatalytic degradation of PFOA under visible light irradiation. The
   samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform
   infrared, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. Compared with BOI (k(1) = 0.0044 h(-)(1)), BHZA (k(2) =
   0.0054 h(-)(1)), and BOI0.04-BHZA (k(3) = 0.0073 h(-1)), the degradation
   rate constant of Bi5O2I/ZnO n-n heterojunction microspheres (k(4) =
   0.013 h(-1)) increased by 2.9, 2.4, and 1.8 times, respectively.
   Approximately 91% of PFOA was degraded after 6 h of irradiation. The
   excellent photocatalytic performance was ascribed to the Bi5O2I/ZnO n-n
   heterojunction formed by calcination, which enlarged the photoresponse
   to the visible light region and increased the separation efficiency of
   electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the degradation pathway of PFOA was
   investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry and ion chromatography assisted by density functional
   theory calculations. The results demonstrated that the carboxylic groups
   of PFOA was vulnerable to attack by the photoproduction hole. The formed
   unstable perfluoroheptyl radicals transformed into shorter chain
   perfluorocarboxylic acids by the elimination of CF2 units. It was
   expected that this Bi5O2I/ZnO n-n heterojunction photocatalyst would be
   a promising candidate for PFOA treatment.

AB The combination of LDHs nanocontainer and organic inhibitor demonstrates
   a great prospect in the field of corrosion protection. Whereas the
   traditional ion exchange method has a low efficiency owing to the small
   space and the firm force between the LDHs laminates. A high-efficiency
   approach of intercalating organic inhibitor into the LDHs is delivered
   in this work. The MgAl-LDHs loaded with 5-aminoindazole (AIA) were
   synthesized by separating the layered structures of hydrotalcites into
   single-layer nanosheets and then restructuring the exfoliated nanosheets
   with organic inhibitor. The as-synthesized LDHs-AIAdisplayed a
   controlled release behavior and excellent anti-corrosion performance on
   the copper in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, which were characterized by UV-vis
   spectra and electrochemical tests. Furthermore, a series of structure
   and morphology tests involving SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS and TGA were
   also used for further analysis the LDHs. And the analysis of corrosion
   products and the anti-corrosion mechanism were carried out by SEM, XRD
   tests. The theoretical calculations concerning the adsorption of
   corrosion inhibitors on the copper surface were also investigated. It
   can be concluded that the inhibitor-loaded LDHs have the ability to
   adjustably release the corrosion inhibitor in corrosive medium,
   thereafter the corrosion inhibitor can adsorb onto the active sites of
   copper surface to prevent corrosion.

   antioxidative, antimicrobial activities and better mechanical
   properties. FT-IR was used to investigate the intermolecular
   interactions and structural changes in the films. Scanning electron
   microscopy revealed the surface morphology, homogeneity and miscibility
   of the developed films. The thermal stability of the films was confirmed
   by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The
   eco-friendly nature of the developed films was demonstrated by water
   solubility and soil degradation properties. The pectin-based

AB In this study, the effect of waste glass on the mechanical properties of
   concrete was examined by conducting a series of compressive strength,
   splitting tensile strength and flexural strength tests. According to
   this aim, waste glass powder (WGP) was first used as a partial
   replacement for cement and six different ratios of WGP were utilized in
   concrete production: 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. To examine the
   combined effect of different ratios of WGP on concrete performance,
   mixed samples (10%, 20%, 30%) were then prepared by replacing cement,
   and fine and coarse aggregates with both WGP and crashed glass
   particles. Workability and slump values of concrete produced with
   different amounts of waste glass were determined on the fresh state of
   concrete, and these properties were compared with those of plain
   concrete. For the hardened concrete, 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm cubic
   specimens and cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 100 mm and a
   height of 200 mm were tested to identify the compressive strength and
   splitting tensile strength of the concrete produced with waste glass.
   Next, a three-point bending test was carried out on samples with
   dimensions of 100 x 100 x 400 mm, and a span length of 300 mm to obtain
   the flexure behavior of different mixtures. According to the results
   obtained, a 20% substitution of WGP as cement can be considered the
   optimum dose. On the other hand, for concrete produced with combined WGP
   and crashed glass particles, mechanical properties increased up to a
   certain limit and then decreased owing to poor workability. Thus, 10%
   can be considered the optimum replacement level, as combined waste glass
   shows considerably higher strength and better workability properties.
   Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was performed
   to investigate the microstructure of the composition. Good adhesion was
   observed between the waste glass and cementitious concrete. Lastly,
   practical empirical equations have been developed to determine the
   compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexure strength
   of concrete with different amounts of waste glass. Instead of conducting
   an experiment, these strength values of the concrete produced with glass
   powder can be easily estimated at the design stage with the help of
   proposed expressions.

AB This study aims to evaluate the macro-micro-meso-mechanical properties
   of basalt fiber (BF)-reinforced recycled aggregate concrete (BFRAC).
   Firstly, the effects of BF with different contents and lengths on the
   mechanical properties of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) at different
   ages were analyzed. In addition, the distribution of BF, bond between BF
   and matrix, failure form of BF, and element composition of the fiber
   interface transition zone were analyzed using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
   Finally, the numerical simulation of cubic compression and splitting
   tensile tests of RAC specimens were carried out, and the stress-strain
   curve and failure morphology of RAC under static loading was studied.
   The results show that BF content is the main factor affecting the
   mechanical properties of concrete within the range of test fiber content
   (0.1%-0.3%), and the optimal content of BF is 0.2%. The length of BF has
   little effect on the compressive properties of RAC, but the increase of
   BF length can improve the splitting tensile and flexural properties of
   RAC. Through SEM-EDS, the toughening and cracking resistance mechanisms
   of the BF are obtained. In the meso-simulation, the numerical simulation
   results are in high agreement with the experimental phenomenon, and this
   method provides an effective technical method for the prediction and
   establishment of RAC failure model. In summary, the research results can
   be used as reference for the establishment of the RAC mechanical model,
   performance research, and practical engineering application in the
   future.

AB The Metaverse is an immersive virtual universe where users interact with
   each other using an avatar. The Metaverse is promised to offer numerous
   opportunities for many sectors. While the Metaverse promotes the social
   interaction between users, there is a scarcity of knowledge on what
   affects its social sustainability. Hence, this research develops a model
   by integrating the UTAUT2 constructs and big five personality traits to
   understand the social sustainability of the Metaverse. The model is
   tested by employing a hybrid covariance-based structural equation
   modeling (CB-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) approach based on
   collecting data from 446 Metaverse users. The CB-SEM results showed that
   performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, price
   value, habit, agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness significantly
   impact the social sustainability of the Metaverse, while no significant
   effect is reported regarding effort expectancy, facilitating conditions,
   conscientiousness, and extraversion. All these factors explained 80% of
   the variance in social sustainability. The ANN results showed that habit
   is the most important factor in predicting social sustainability.
   Drawing on these findings, the study offers several theoretical
   contributions and sheds light on several practical implications for
   developers, designers, and decision-makers promoting the use of the
   Metaverse.

AB A novel strategy was described to fabricate GO/CuBDC-Fe3O4 ternary
   nanocomposite using a green solvothermal method. The physicochemical
   properties of the ternary nanocomposite were probed by ATR-FTIR, WA-XRD,
   Raman, FE-SEM, TEM/HRTEM, STEM/mapping, and EDS spectroscopy. In this
   nanocomposite, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were used as an ideal
   platform for CuBDC metal-organic framework (MOF) and Fe3O4 growth,
   aiming to create a peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator to degrade
   ciprofloxacin (CIP) antibiotics expeditiously. The proposed ternary
   nanocomposite showed highest degradation rate of CIP (98.5%) within 24
   min with rate constant of 0.191 min(-1). The findings demonstrated that
   Cu/Fe species and (CO)-O-= groups within ternary nanocomposite catalyzed
   PMS synergistically to the formation of the hydroxyl and sulfate
   radicals for CIP degradation. Furthermore, the ternary nanocomposite
   showed good recyclability enabling facile separation of the catalyst
   from reaction mixtures using an external magnet. On the other hand,
   radical quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) reveal
   that the (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- a vital role in the
   degradation process. The current protocol can be a useful criterion in
   designing and fabrication of various ternary nanocomposites and provides
   new insight into environmental remediation.

AB Biodegradable cellulose based on sugarcane bagasse is produced using
   alkaline treatment followed by bleaching method for dye removal. FTIR,
   Raman, SEM, EDS, XRD, and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis
   were utilized to characterize the surface morphology and functional
   groups of the sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and treated sugarcane bagasse
   (TSCB). The TSCB was investigated to remove of Crystal violet (CV) and
   Methylene blue (MB). Different factors influence the adsorption
   processes such as contact time, adsorbent dose, dye concentration,
   temperature, pH, and NaCl dose were studied. The Langmuir model was
   investigated to study the adsorption equilibrium behavior of CV and MB
   dyes by TSCB. A maximum adsorption capacities (q(max)) of 107.5 and
   112.9 mgg(-1) was calculated for CV and MB-dyes, respectively. Also, the
   adsorption processes are physi-osorption with average energy values of E
   = 1.151 and 1.101 KJmol(-1) for CV and MB-dyes, respectively. The
   kinetic data of the investigated processes were controlled by the
   pseudo-second order (PSO) model with q(e,cal )(mgg(-1)) values of 59.3
   and 58.9 mgg(-1) for CV and MB-dyes, respectively. Suggesting that
   chemical mechanisms may influence the removal of CV and MB dyes.
   Overall, TSCB was found to be an effective, environmentally friendly,
   and low-cost material to remove of cationic dyes in this research. (c)

AB The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to global
   operations and supply chains. While the huge impact of the pandemic has
   nurtured important literature over the last couple of years, little is
   being said about the role of resource orchestration in supporting
   resilience in highly disruptive contexts. Thus, this study aims to this
   knowledge gap by proposing an original model to explore supply chain
   resilience (SCRE) antecedents, considering supply chain alertness (SCAL)
   as a central point to support resilience. This study focuses on the
   resource orchestration theory (ROT) to design a conceptual model. The
   partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) served to
   validate the model, exploring data from the UK supply chain
   decision-makers. The study reveals a number of both expected and
   unexpected findings. These include the evidence that supply chain
   disruption orientation (SCDO) has a strong positive effect on the SCAL.
   In addition, SCAL plays a strong positive effect in resource
   reconfiguration (RREC), supply chain efficiency (SCEF) and SCRE. We
   further identified a partial mediation effect of RREC on the
   relationship between SCAL and SCRE. Surprisingly, it appeared that SCAL
   strongly influences SCEF, while SCEF itself does not create any
   significant effect on SCRE. For managers and practitioners, the
   importance of resource orchestration as a decisive approach to
   adequately respond to huge disruptions is clearly highlighted by our
   results. Finally, this paper helps to grasp better how important
   resource orchestration in operations and supply chains remains for
   appropriate responses to high disruptions such as the COVID-19 impacts.

AB Tetracycline (TC) has been frequently detected in various environments,
   thus promoting the occurrence of resistance in bacterial populations. In
   this study, a suite of soybean straw biochars (SSBs) were fabricated
   under different pyrolysis temperatures (600-1000 degrees C), which were
   utilized as peroxydisulfate (PS) activators for TC degradation and TC
   resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) disinfection. The purification
   effect of SSBs/PS systems manifested obvious positive dependence on
   pyrolysis temperature of SSBs with SSB1000/PS system obtained the
   superior TC degradation, E. coli disinfection and coexisting TC and E.
   coli elimination capacity. The leakage of intracellular DNA and the
   degradation of total DNA and extracellular DNA was revealed no matter in
   alone E. coli or combined pollution which can also be supported by the
   gradual ruptured bacterial morphology and attenuated internal
   components. It can be found that TC adsorption in SSBs played a
   significant role on TC degradation, while the electrostatic repulsion
   always existed between E. coli and SSB1000. Furthermore, a battery of
   solid evidences collectively demonstrated the significant different
   purification mechanism of TC and E. coli. The TC degradation was
   achieved dominantly by surface-bound radicals, while bactericidal
   activity should be attributed to free SO4 center dot- in bulk solutions.
   In contrast to other SSBs, the largest mesopore volumes, highest C=O
   content, lowest interfacial charge transfer resistance and strongest
   electron donating capacity explained the outperformed catalytic
   performance of SSB1000.

AB In this paper, a simple solvothermal synthesis method was proposed for
   the preparation of metal organic framework/graphene oxide hybrid
   nanocomposite (UiO-67/GO). A series of UiO-67/GO composites were
   prepared by varying the addition forms and amounts of GO, and the
   optimal synthesis conditions were screened. The composites were
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR), transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS), water contact
   angles (CA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The adsorption
   capacity and the adsorption process of toluene were investigated by
   dynamic adsorption and adsorption kinetics, respectively. The results
   indicated that 67/GO-0.5% reached the maximum adsorption capacity (876
   mg g(-1)), which far exceeded the other adsorbents. Kinetic model and
   the Weber-Morris model correlated satisfactorily to the experimental
   data. The improved adsorption performance was attributed to GO, which
   enhanced p-p interaction, promoted defect generation and provided more
   adsorption sites. Finally, the excellent regeneration performance of the
   adsorbent was verified by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and
   cyclic adsorption-desorption experiments. Moreover, the adsorption
   mechanism was further revealed. Combined with the related adsorption
   experiments and the density functional theory (DFT) analysis, the
   efficient removal of toluene by UiO-67/GO was attributed to the
   cooperation of defects, pi-pi interaction and hydrogen bonding. (c) 2022

   UV-light barrier properties. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of all
   GCH/ LSE substantially improved from 9.46 to 91.52%, more than a
   ten-fold increase compared to composite neat GCH film. Finally, the
   oxidative stability of roasted peanuts packed in fabricated GCH/LSE
   sachets improved after 8 days. Guar gum/carboxymethyl cellulose
   containing LSE as an antioxidant agent could be applied as food
   packaging for low water activity oxygen-sensitive food.

AB This study aimed to examine and compare alkali treatment influences on
   the microstructure, chemical composition, and thermal properties of
   parenchyma cells and fibers in bamboo. The parenchyma cells and fibers
   were isolated mechanically from the same bamboo and were subsequently
   treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at various concentrations (2, 5,
   10, 15, and 25 %) for 2h followed by air-drying. The alkali-treated
   parenchyma cells and fibers were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   chemical composition analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The
   results showed that the parenchyma cells collapsed and fibers separated
   when treated by NaOH with a concentration of greater than 10 %. The
   starch in parenchyma cells could be extracted as individualized granules
   by alkali solution, particularly at 2% NaOH. The alkali treatment could
   partly remove lignin from parenchyma cells but almost did not affect
   hemicellulose content. In comparison, both lignin and hemicellulose in
   fiber were removed after alkali treatment. Cellulose I was transformed
   to cellulose II in parenchyma cell after treated by 15 % and 25 % NaOH
   solutions, while the transformation of cellulose I to cellulose II
   occurred in fibers only at a concentration of 25 %. Parenchyma cells had
   lower thermal stability than fibers. The alkali treatment influenced the
   parenchyma cells? thermal stability more pronouncedly than that of
   fibers.

AB The photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide (TiO2) for the
   purification of odour pollutants, containing reduced sulfur compounds
   (RSCs), could be largely improved by the coupling of porous materials.
   Herein, UiO-66@TiO2 nanocomposites with different blending ratios were
   synthesized via a readily solvothermal method and characterized
   experimentally by XRD (X-ray diffraction), SEM (scanning electron
   microscope), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectrum), N2 isotherms,
   and UV-vis DRS (diffuse reflectance spectra). The photodegradation
   performance of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) by synthesized UiO-66@TiO2 was
   investigated under various photodegradation conditions, including
   photocatalyst dosage, DMS concentrations and relative humidity. The
   results showed that the U1T3 (UiO-66:TiO2 = 1:3) composites exhibited
   the highest photocatalytic activity, which was about 17.8 and 7.1 times
   higher than that of pristine UiO-66 and TiO2, respectively. This
   indicates that the intimate contact interfaces between UiO-66 and TiO2
   could promote the separation and migration efficiency of photogenerated
   electron-hole pairs. When relative humidity increased from 0% to 60%,
   the photocatalytic activity was enhanced because the moisture could
   assist to produce more hydroxyl radicals. However, when the relative
   humidity was further increased to 90%, the excessive water would compete
   with DMS on the surface of UiO-66 and subsequently weaken the
   photocatalytic effects. During the cycling experiments, U1T3 showed a
   stable photocatalytic performance, and the plausible photocatalytic
   reaction mechanism and reaction pathways of DMS were proposed. With a
   significant enhancement of photocatalytic performance, UiO-66@TiO2
   nanocomposites could promote the practical applications of MOF-based
   photocatalysts for the degradation of DMS.

AB The concept of a successful building project should be implemented
   across the project's lifecycle phases to obtain maximum profits without
   compromising the standard. Although BIM implementation in developing
   countries is limited, much research has focused on BIM drivers. However,
   there is less evidence to thoroughly investigate the influence of BIM
   barriers and awareness on the project lifecycle. This study addresses
   barriers to BIM implementation in building projects in developing
   countries. It investigates the influence of BIM barriers on awareness of
   BIM during the project lifecycle. Thus, a comprehensive literature
   review is required to build a conceptual model. Subsequently, the
   Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was
   developed using a questionnaire survey tool. Data were collected from 90
   building experts in Nigeria. The model's outputs highlighted that cost
   and standards, process and economic, technology and business, and
   training and people are the most critical barriers to BIM implementation
   that should be avoided. Furthermore, the model prediction revealed that
   eliminating BIM barriers has a minor impact on sufficient knowledge
   throughout the building project lifecycle. The findings provide the
   basis for policy making in developing countries concerning the
   successful completion of projects by avoiding BIM barriers; it will
   likewise enhance the success of building projects through BIM.

AB It remains a great challenge to design and achieve fluorine-free
   superhydrophobic materials for multifunctional applications through
   facile and substrate-independent approaches. Herein,
   environmental-friendly superhydrophobic composite coating was fabricated
   with the combination of nano zinc oxide (nano-ZnO) and
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) via a versatile spray-coating method. The
   surface wettability, micro-nano morphologies and chemical compositions
   of the superhydrophobic ZnO@PDMS coating were investigated through
   contact angle meter, FE-SEM, AFM, EDS, XPS and FTIR techniques. The
   optimal superhydrophobic ZnO@PDMS coating with water contact angle (WCA)
   of 158.3 +/- 1.7 degrees and sliding angle of 6.2 +/- 1.8 degrees can be
   achieved with the nano-ZnO/PDMS mass ratio of 1.5:1. The self-cleaning
   and anti-fouling ability was evaluated based on the solid and liquid
   contaminants. The electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) results
   verified that the superhydrophobic ZnO@PDMS coating exhibits a larger
   capacitive arc diameter, enhanced charge transfer resistance and
   vertical bar Z vertical bar(0.01) Hz value at the low frequency,
   suggesting an improvement of anti-corrosion performance. Besides, the
   mechanical robustness and stability of the superhydrophobic ZnO@PDMS
   coating were evaluated through tape-peeling and sandpaper abrasion
   tests, which provides potential applications towards real-world
   applications.

AB A novel modified rice husk (MRH) has been prepared for removing cationic
   dyes in both single system and binary system. SEM-EDS, FT-IR, XRD and
   XPS were used to characterize the physical and chemical properties of
   MRH. It showed that the maximum adsorption capacity of MRH for methyl
   violet (MV) and malachite green (MG) in single system was 154.49 and
   996.97 mg g(-1), while in binary system was 530.94 and 408.58 mg g(-1),
   respectively. The experimental results showed that the
   pseudo-second-order kinetic model was better to describe the kinetic
   behavior of MV and MG adsorption. By using double layer adsorption
   model, we found that the n D for MV adsorption were 2.52, 2.65 and 3.34
   at 298, 308 and 318 K, respectively, and the n D for MG adsorption were
   4.59, 4.85 and 4.30, respectively. These results illustrated that
   multiple dye molecules were adsorbed on one adsorption site in
   non-parallel direction, indicating that the adsorption of dyes is
   multi-molecular mechanism. Furthermore, synergistic and antagonistic
   adsorption might be existed simultaneously in binary system. In summary,
   MRH has been shown well adsorption properties and reusability and our
   finding might provide a new idea for developing low-cost, efficient and
   reusable adsorbent to remove dyes from wastewater.

   the pseudo-second-order method. Isotherms were effectively simulated
   based on the Langmuir model. The maximal adsorption capability of Cd
   (II) and Pb (II) can reach 510.2 mg/g and 1397.62 mg/g, exceeding those
   of conventional adsorbents. The adsorption mechanisms of

   complexation, ion exchange, and chemical deposition between
   FeMgLDH@bentonite and heavy metals. Moreover, FeMg-LDH@bentonite was
   found to have a promising application for practically treating

   (CuO NPs). CuO NPs were characterized using ultraviolet-visible
   spectroscopy, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). XRD
   analysis revealed the monoclinic phase of synthesized CuO NPs with an
   average particle size of 20 nm. Spherical shaped nanoscale CuO particles
   were observed by EDX and SEM confirming the Cu and O presence in the
   synthesized NPs. CuO NPs showed antibacterial effects against Bacillus
   subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi. The
   antioxidant effect was measured and IC50 values for 2,2 '-azino-bis
   (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS),
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and Ferric reducing antioxidant power
   assays were found to be 91.2, 72.4 and 109 mu g mL(- 1) respectively.
   Under sunlight, the CuO NPs reported extraordinary photocatalytic
   activity against Methylene Blue and Methyl Red degradation with
   efficiencies of 92-85%. CuO NPs have excellent potential application for
   the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and in the
   development of antibacterial materials. This study offers new insights
   in the field of inexpensive and green synthesis-based antimicrobial
   effective CuO photocatalysts from B. ciliata to remove harmful dyes from
   industrial-based waters with high degradation efficiency, which is

AB A highly efficient absorber with features including lightweight, broad
   bandwidth, and tunable electromagnetic property still remains
   challenging for practical applications. Herein, the Porphyra - derived
   porous carbon (PPC) was fabricated via facile procedures of
   low-temperature pre-carbonization combined with KOH chemical activation.
   The composition, microstructure, and electromagnetic wave absorption
   properties of the samples were elucidated based on X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer
   ???Emmer ???Teller (BET), and vector network analyzer (VNA). The
   porosity of PPC can be readily regulated by adjusting activation
   temperature. The PPC obtained at 750 ??C was composed of a
   threedimensional hierarchically porous carbon network. The C and N
   elements of natural Porphyra were introduced into the carbon skeleton
   during the carbonization process. The large specific surface, dopants,
   and three-dimensional hierarchically porous carbon network can
   effectively improve the impedance matching and dielectric dissipation,
   leading to an excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance.
   Especially, the optimal reflection loss (RL) value reached ???57.75 dB
   at 9.68 GHz with a broad bandwidth (RL < ???10 dB) value of 7.60 GHz at
   3.5 mm. Overall, the results indicate that the PPC can provide a new way
   to achieve lightweight, effective, and sustainable absorbers. ?? 2022

   starch and cobalt-ferrite (CoFe2O4) (MC/starch/CoFe2O4) and then used to
   eliminate methyl violet (MV) and methylene blue (MB) dyes from water.
   The materials swere characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM/EDX/Map, VSM, BET
   and TEM analyses. Also, central composite design (CCD) method was
   employed to optimize the effective factors on the uptake process. The
   utmost sorption efficiency using the MC/starch/CoFe2O4 nanocomposite
   were obtained 98.67% (MB) and 99.45% (MV), respectively, indicating
   significant sorption efficiencies. Also, the utmost sorption capacity of
   MV using MC, MC/CoFe2O4 and MC/starch/CoFe2O4 nanocomposite were 29.76,
   34.79 and 43.95 mg/g, respectively, and the utmost sorption capacity of
   MB using these sorbents were 31.96, 36.91 and 47.51 mg/g, respectively.
   Among the studied models, the sorption data were more consistent with

   dyes using the nanocomposite was physical, favorable, and exothermic.
   Also, MC/starch/CoFe2O4 nanocomposite was able to clean textile

AB In recent years, an ever-increasing amount researchers dedicated
   themselves to exploring the possibility of introducing recycled concrete
   powder (RCP) into concrete as a substitute for cement. To optimize the
   effect of RCP on cement-based materials, this paper uses nano-silica
   (NS) to learn the hydration and mechanical properties of cement-based
   materials with RCP. The results indicated that after adding NS into
   RCP-cement pastes, the setting time of cement pastes was significantly
   reduced, while the samples' early hydration rate and hydration heat
   increased. Besides, the mechanical strength of the mortar decreased as
   RCP replaced part of the cement, while 2% NS can compensate for the
   mechanical strength loss of mortar caused by RCP as supplementary
   cementing materials. The X-ray computer tomography (X-ray CT) and
   mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) results showed that RCP increased
   mortar's pore volume fraction and porosity. In contrast, NS in RCP
   blended mortar significantly decreased the number of pores with a pore
   volume between 0.01 and 0.03 mm(3) and increased the proportion of
   harmless pores (From 28.6% to 31.4%). Hence, NS reduced the pore volume
   fraction and porosity of mortar. The results of X-ray CT and MIP showed
   that NS could refine the pore size in RCP blended mortar. X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) further
   revealed that the existence of NS can eliminate the adverse effects
   brought by RCP.

AB Hierarchically porous activated Starbons (R) derived from starch are
   found to make excellent adsorbents for methylene blue, even in the
   presence of other dyes and inorganic salts, highlighting their potential
   to be used in water purification. The optimal material (S950C90) has a
   methylene blue adsorption capacity (891 mg g-1) almost nine times higher
   than that of unactivated S800 and four times higher than that of
   commercial activated carbon at 298 K. The adsorption of methylene blue
   onto optimal materials (S950C90 and S800K4) reaches equilibrium within 5
   min. Adsorption data for all the adsorbents show a good fit to the
   Freundlich isotherm which allows the Gibbs free energies of adsorption
   to be calculated. The adsorption capacities increase as the pH of the
   methylene blue solution increases, allowing the dye to be desorbed by
   treatment with acidic ethanol and the Starbon (R) materials reused.
   Porosimetry and SEM-EDX imaging indicate that methylene blue adsorbs
   throughout the surface and completely fills all the micropores in the
   Starbon (R) adsorbent. The methylene blue adsorption capacities show
   excellent correlations with both the BET surface areas and the micropore
   volumes of the materials.

AB Removal of pharmaceutical wastes, especially antibiotics from aquatic
   systems is an imperative issue from both human-health and ecological
   perspectives. Herein, zwitterionic UiO-66/ZIF-8 binary MOF/
   polydopamine@cellulose acetate composite (UiO-66/ZIF-8/PDA@CA) were
   fabricated in the form of floated beads for the adsorptive removal of
   tetracycline (TC). The formulated composite beads were char-acterized by
   FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, Zeta potential and XPS analysis tools. Under
   optimum adsorption con-ditions, the UiO-66/ZIF-8/PDA@CA composite beads
   demonstrated large specific surface area, good adsorption performance
   with a relatively short equilibrium time (60 min) and ease separation.
   Furthermore, the adsorption data fit Temkin > Langmuir > Freundlich with
   a maximal adsorption capacity of 290.69 mg/g at 25 degrees C, while the
   adsorption kinetics were well-described by pseudo-second order
   kinet-ics. The thermodynamics studies refereed that the adsorption
   process was endothermic and spontaneous. Besides, the floated
   UiO-66/ZIF-8/PDA@CA beads displayed better adsorption property for eight
   reuse cycles with a maximal removal (%) reached 67%, reflecting its
   promising applicability as reusable adsor-bent for efficient removal of
   antibiotics from water bodies.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB The oily wastewater is one of the major waste streams generated due to
   industrialization. The membrane technology has prominent advantages in
   the field of oily wastewater treatment. In present investigation,
   halloysite nanotubes (Hal) and polydopamine (PDA) were utilized to
   synergistically modify MXene followed by the fabrication of a series of
   Hal@MXene-PDA two-dimensional (2D) composite membranes by vacuum
   filtration. Observing the morphology of the membrane and exploring the
   change in interlayer space by scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic
   force microscope (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), it was confirmed
   that, the composite membrane was successfully modified. The results
   revealed that, the Hal@MXene-PDA composite membrane exhibits higher
   hydrophilicity compared to the virgin membrane. The pure water flux
   using the composite membrane was found to be 5036.2
   L.m(-2).h-(1).bar(-1), and the rejections of petroleum ether and
   lubricating oil were evaluated as 99.8%. The modified membrane(M6) also
   shows good anti-fouling ability in the anti-fouling cycle test and hence
   can be considered as a potential candidate for oil-water separation.

AB In this paper, we describe efficient, inexpensive, and donor-acceptor
   (D-A) systems based on conjugated microporous polymers incorporating
   thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (ThTh) linkages for the extraction of H2 from
   H2O under visible light in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) as a
   sacrificial electron donor without additional noble metals as
   co-catalyst. The integration of electron-rich pyrene (Py) and
   electron-deficient ThTh units in Py-ThThCMP resulted in a D-A system
   that provided an H2 evolution rate (HER) of 1874 mu mol g-1h- 1; this
   value was greater than those of the other tested CMPs prepared with and
   without the ThTh acceptor moiety. Notably, PyThTh-CMP also exceeded the
   HERs of many other reported materials for photocatalytic H2O reduction,
   including co-catalysts based on covalent organic frameworks, CMPs, and
   graphitic carbon nitride. The DFT and TD-DFT suggested the incorporation
   of ThTh moiety in the CMPs backbone to enhance the charge transfer via
   S1 <-> T1 and contribute to the H2 formation. This study presents a new
   approach for preparing highly efficient photocatalysts for the practical
   development of cost-effective H2 evolution.

AB Blackcurrant anthocyanins (BCA) can be used to improve the structure and
   properties of konjac glucomannan (KGM)/carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)
   composite film. In this study, the microstructure of the KGM/CMC/BCA
   composite film was evaluated. The results show that BCA is uniformly
   dispersed in the KC matrix, which changes the mechanical properties of
   the film (tensile strength (TS): 55.00 -> 38.44 MPa and elongation at
   break (EB): 8.60 -> 3.67%) and barrier properties (water vapor
   permeability (WVP): 0.67 -> 2.53 g.mm/m(2) day kPa). With the addition
   of BCA (0.05, 0.15, 0.20 wt%), the composite film exhibits higher
   thermal stability. Among them, 0.15 wt% has the best thermal stability.
   The composite film also shows the antioxidant and antibacterial
   properties of BCA, and has an inhibitory effect on food-borne pathogens.
   The composite film will show different colors in different buffers,
   which can be observed with the naked eye. Therefore, KGM/CMC/BCA film
   can be applied to smart food packaging to realize real-time monitoring
   of meat product quality.

AB With the increase in global food demand and the destruction of
   environment, the development of sustainable agriculture has become
   increasingly more important. Stimuli-responsive controlled-release
   agrochemicals enhance the bioavailability of active ingredients and
   reduce the frequency of use and environmental pollution. Herein,
   3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid was used as a functional bridge to
   covalently link the degradable natural polymer zein and chitosan
   oligosaccharides (CS) to prepare a water-dispersed environmentally
   friendly pesticide carrier. Subsequently, via hydrophobic and hydrogen
   bonding interactions photo-decomposable avermectin (AVM) was
   encapsulated forming a stimuli-responsive intelligent nanopesticide
   delivery system (AVM@CS-SS-Zein) was developed by encapsulating in the
   carrier. AVM was released slowly from AVM@CS-SS-Zein particles in a
   neutral condition and was released rapidly under stimulation of
   glutathione and alkalinity in simulated insects. The photostability of
   AVM@CS-SS-Zein was improved by 6-fold compared with that of AVM and the
   nanoparticles had good adherence to the leaves, slowly releasing AVM and
   avoiding the light decomposition of active ingredients. When the pests
   ingest the leaves containing AVM@CS-SS-Zein, the rapid disintegration of
   the nanoparticles in vivo leads to a good insecticidal effect and the
   control rate of AVM@CS-SS-Zein on Plutella xylostella was higher than
   that of AVM. After 120 h of UV irradiation, the pest mortality rate of
   AVM@CS-SS-Zein was 46.7% while that of AVM and AVM emulsifiable
   concentrate was only 13.3% and 20.0%, respectively. Therefore, this
   pH/redox dual stimuli-responsive nanopesticide formulation achieves
   target control of pests and provides an efficient nanoplatform for green
   agriculture.

AB This study attempts to understand the role of artificial
   intelligence-driven big data analytics capability in hu-manitarian
   relief operations. These disasters play an important role in mobilizing
   several organizations to counteract them, but the organizations often
   find it hard to strike a fine balance between agility and resilience.
   Operations Management Scholars' opinion remains divided between
   responsiveness and efficiency. However, to manage unexpected events like
   disasters, organizations need to be agile and resilient. In previous
   studies, scholars have adopted the resource-based view or dynamic
   capability view to explain the combination of re-sources and
   capabilities (i.e., technology, agility, and resilience) to explain
   their performance. However, following some recent scholarly debates, we
   argue that organizational theories like the resource-based view or
   dynamic capability view are not suitable enough to explain humanitarian
   supply chain performance. As the underlying assumptions of the
   commercial supply chain do not hold true in the case of the humanitarian
   supply chain. We note this as a potential research gap in the existing
   literature. Moreover, humanitarian organizations remain sceptical
   regarding the adoption of artificial intelligence-driven big data
   analytics capability (AI-BDAC) in the decision-making process. To
   address these potential gaps, we grounded our theoretical model in the
   practice-based view which is proposed as an appropriate lens to examine
   the role of practices that are not rare and are easy to imitate in
   performance. We used Partial Least Squares (PLS) to test our theoretical
   model and research hypotheses, using 171 useable responses gathered
   through a web survey of international non-governmental organizations
   (NGOs). The findings of our study suggest that AI-BDAC is a significant
   determi-nant of agility, resilience, and performance of the humanitarian
   supply chain. Furthermore, the reduction of the level of information
   complexity (IC) on the paths joining agility, resilience, and
   performance in the humanitarian supply chain. These results offer some
   useful theoretical contributions to the contingent view of the practice
   -based view. In a way, we have tried to establish empirically that the
   humanitarian supply chain designs are quite different from their
   commercial counterparts. Hence, the use of a resource-based view or
   dynamic capa-bility view as theoretical lenses may not help capture true
   perspectives. Thus, the use of a practice-based view as an alternative
   theoretical lens provides a better understanding of humanitarian supply
   chains. We have further outlined the limitations and the future research
   directions of the study.

AB AgCl/ZnO/g-C3N4, a visible light activated ternary composite catalyst,
   was prepared by combining calcination, hydrothermal reaction and in-situ
   deposition processes to treat/photocatalyse tetracycline hydrochloride
   (TC- HCl) from pharmaceutical wastewater under visible light. The
   morphological, structural, electrical, and optical features of the novel
   photocatalyst were characterized using scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), UV-visible light absorption spectrum (UV-Vis DRS), X-ray
   diffractometer (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transient photocurrent
   techniques. All analyses confirmed that the formation of heterojunctions
   between AgCl/ZnO and g-C3N4 significantly increase electron-hole
   transfer and separation compared to pure ZnO and g-C3N4. Thus,
   AgCl/ZnO/g-C3N4 could exhibit superior photocatalytic activity during
   TC-HCl assays (over 90% removal) under visible light irradiation. The
   composite could maintain its photocatalytic stability even after four
   consecutive reaction cycles. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 ) and superoxide
   radical (O-2) contributed more than holes (h(+)) and hydroxyl radicals
   (center dot OH) to the degradation process as showed by trapping
   experiments. Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) was used for
   the representation of the TC-HCl potential degradation pathway. The
   applicability and the treatment potential of AgCl/ZnO/g-C3N4 against
   actual pharmaceutical wastewater showed that the composite can achieve
   removal efficiencies of 81.7%, 71.4% and 69.0% for TC-HCl, chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) respectively.
   AgCl/ZnO/g-C3N4 can be a prospective key photocatalyst in the field of
   degradation of persistent, hardly-degradable pollutants, from industrial
   wastewater and not only. (C) 2022 The Research Center for

   no longer an option, particularly for businesses in general and
   small-medium enterprises (SMEs) for long-term viability and
   sustainability. The present research examines the relationship between
   corporate green strategy and sustainable firm performance for SMEs by
   exploring the mediating role of corporate social responsibility and
   green innovation in the given context in an emerging economy. This study
   applies a quantitative approach by using a well-structured questionnaire
   for data collection. The target respondents were managers at senior and
   middle levels. There were 469 valid responses obtained from the main
   survey. The final data was included in the analysis using Smart PLS
   (version 3.3.2) Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to investigate the
   relationships between constructs and latent variables and provides an
   extension to the current literature by providing an integrated model of
   corporate green strategy, green corporate social responsibility, green
   innovation and sustainable firm performance. In addition, the model's
   application to the emerging economy reinforces the originality of this
   study. This study therefore provides an integration of "three green"
   elements in a model which is also unexplored by the extant literature.
   Specifically, green strategy, green corporate social responsibility and
   green innovation are integrated, aiming to facilitate enterprises,
   improve environmental performance, enhance sustainable competitive
   advantages and achieve firm sustainability. Moreover, this study
   provides strategic thinking for long-term business development towards a
   sustainable balance of economic, social and environmental benefits,
   through which business leaders are encouraged to consider practical
   actions carefully to improve environmental performance as this is
   certain to develop business competitiveness and achieve sustainable
   business performance.

   anthocyanins extract (LRM) as pH-sensitive pigments into two
   polyelectrolyte complex films composed of chitin whiskers (CW) and
   sodium alginate (SA)/gelatin (GE), respectively. The analysis results of
   FTIR, SEM and DSC show that, compared with the single polysaccharide
   system of SA or GE, the composite film with addition of CW has better
   water resistance and thermal stability, due to the existence of hydrogen
   bonds and electrostatic interactions. Meanwhile, the adhesion to LRM is
   also enhanced. At the same time, through Ritger-Peppas kinetic model
   analysis, the release process of anthocyanins in the two film systems
   was analyzed. The CW/SA/LRM system membrane showed good responsiveness
   to lactic acid and was successfully used in the detection of milk
   freshness; while the CW/GE/LRM system membrane showed good
   responsiveness to amine gases and has been successfully used in the
   detection of pork freshness. The study revealed that the above
   colorimetric films demonstrate excellent durability and accuracy in food
   freshness monitoring.

AB Sliver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were loaded on chitosan (CS) and
   incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to develop novel active food
   packaging films. AgNPs were fabricated by liquid phase chemical
   reduction method using CS and sodium citrate friendly reductant of
   AgNO3. The silver we prepared was found to be nanoscale by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) and AgNPs were homogeneously dispersed in the
   matrix by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The composite film
   exhibited excellence mechanical properties with tensile strength of
   49.97 MPa and elongation at break of 275.90%. When the concentration of
   AgNPs was 0.019% (w/w), the diameter of filter paper was 5.00 mm and the
   inhibition zone against Escherichia coli reached 16.07 mm at 37 degrees
   C for 8 h. The water vapor permeability and water solubility of the
   Ag@CS/PVA films decreased with the incor-poration of AgNPs, and this was
   beneficial for food preservation. Especially, Ag@CS/PVA films could
   reduce the weight loss of strawberries and avoid microbial infection at
   25 +/- 1 degrees C and 50 +/- 5% RH. Benefiting for good mechanical
   properties, antibacterial property, flexibility and high transparency,
   Ag@CS/PVA films showed its great potential in fruit storage and
   transportation application.

AB A robust self-healable superhydrophobic fabric is fabricated via in situ
   diazonium radical polymerization. By employing diazonium salts, Cu
   powder, and ascorbic acid, the hierarchical
   NO2phene-Cu2O/Cu7Cl4(OH)10H2O, CF3phene-Cu2O/Cu7Cl4(OH)10H2O, and
   DCF3phene-Cu2O/Cu7Cl4(OH)10H2O micro/nanostructures with different
   morphologies-nano spindles, nano rods, and nano particles-are
   constructed on the surface of cotton fabric with the driving force of
   7C-7C stacking and hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions under ambient
   conditions. Owing to the strong covalent bond, 7C-7C stacking, and
   hydrophobic interaction, the CF3phene-Cu2O/ Cu7Cl4(OH)10H2O@cotton
   fabric (CF3Ph-CuxO@CF) surface could maintain the superhydrophobicity
   even after 20 cycles of laundering and 1500 cycles of abrasion, showing
   excellent mechanical durability. The developed CF3Ph-CuxO@CF exhibits
   outstanding oil/water separation ability with reliable recyclability and
   stability, allowing it for effective separation of clean water from
   either heavy or light oil contaminants. In addition, it is further shown
   that the superhydrophobic fabric also demonstrated excellent
   self-cleaning, self-healing, ultraviolet (UV) protection, anti-icing,
   and antibacterial capabilities. It is hence believed these valuable
   functions could significantly enhance the practical feasibility of the
   superhydrophobic fabric in various application scenarios.

AB Tetracycline (TC) is a refractory pollutant that widely exists in water
   environments. Therefore, effective TC treatment methods must be
   developed. In this work, a cobalt and iron coloaded pomelo peel biochar
   composite (Co-Fe@PPBC) was successfully synthesized and used to activate
   peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for TC removal. The crystal structure, surface
   morphology, pore structure, and elemental valence of the synthesized
   Co-Fe@PPBC catalyst were investigated by BET, SEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS, TGA,
   Raman, and VSM. The effects of Co-Fe@PPBC dosage, PMS concentration,
   initial pH, initial TC concentration, and coexisting anions on TC
   removal were studied. In comparison with the oxidation (13.6%) by PMS
   alone and adsorption (9.6%) by Co-Fe@PPBC alone, the removal efficiency
   of TC was increased to 86.2% in the Co-Fe@PPBC/PMS system, indicating
   that CoFe@PPBC can successfully activate PMS. Remarkably, the results of
   scavenging examination and EPR analysis demonstrated the synergistic
   effect of free radical and non-free radical pathways in TC degradation.
   The cycling test showed that Co-Fe@PPBC has favourable stability and
   recyclability during repeated activation processes of PMS. Finally,
   three possible TC degradation methods were presented through the
   analysis of eight intermediates. Overall, Co-Fe@PPBC could be an
   economic and high-efficiency catalyst for PMS activation to remove
   organic pollutants in wastewater.

AB Efficient and selective separation of oily substances from water or
   oil-water emulsions is a very important issue in the treatment processes
   of oily wastewater to prevent environmental pollution. In this study,
   for the effective treatment of water polluted with oils or organic
   solvents, highly hydrophobic or superhydrophobic water-insoluble
   eco-friendly electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and agar/PVA membrane
   materials were successfully prepared via (i) electrospinning technique,
   (ii) cross-linking approach with glutaraldehyde and (iii) coating
   process with methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS) in petroleum ether. Membrane
   materials were characterized with contact angle, water solubility,
   FT-IR, SEM and XPS measurements. Water contact angle (WCA) of PVA and
   agar/PVA membranes was measured as 148.1 degrees and 150.1 degrees,
   respectively. Membrane materials were able to separate selectively the
   toluene and chloroform droplets from water and showed good oil and
   organic solvent absorption capacity (5.5-22.8 g g(-1) for PVA membrane
   and 4.1-21.7 g g(-1) for agar/PVA membrane). For chloroform-water
   mixture (1:1, v/v), the flux value of PVA and agar/PVA membranes was
   determined to be 1234 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1) and 1136 L m(-2) h(-1)
   bar(-1), respectively. In addition, the developed membrane materials
   displayed excellent separation efficiency (>= 99.9%) for
   chloroform-water mixture. PVA and agar/PVA membranes exhibited a good
   water-in-oil/organic solvent (water-in-toluene, water-in-chloroform and
   water-in-diesel) emulsion separation performance (>= 97.5%). PVA and
   agar/PVA membrane materials prepared in this study are environmentally
   friendly and have an affordable price and the potential in practical
   applications for the treatment of wastewater polluted with oils and
   organic solvents and for the separation of oily substance-water
   mixtures.

   and its electrochemical sensor application for the determination of
   methyl parathion (MP). The phase structure and surface morphology of the

   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectra. According to the electrochemical tests, the fabricated
   glassy carbon electrode (GCE) sensor with Hal and multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes showed excellent MP determination performance because of the
   synergistic effect of Hal and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The
   Hal-MWCNTs/GCE sensor exhibited a relatively low detection limit of
   0.034 mu M in the linear range of 0.5-11 mu M. When used for the
   determination of MP in real samples, the Hal-MWCNTs/GCE sensor showed
   good detection effect with satisfactory relative standard deviation
   (RSD) of 2.46 to 3.08% and recoveries of 98.8 of 101.8%. This work
   indicated that the nanocomposite of Hal-MWCNTs when coated on GCE is

AB Starch-polyphenols complex with unique physicochemical and functional
   properties has gained research interests. As a method of physical
   modification, plasma treatment leads to smaller fragments of starch,
   which increases the possibility of binding with polyphenols. In this
   study, pregelatinized plasma-modified Tartary buckwheat starch
   (pre-TBS-P), as a new material, was combined with quercetin forming
   complexes (pre-TBS-PQ). The rheological and thermal properties, and
   digestibility of pre-TBS-P-Q were investigated. Results show that
   quercetin complexation increased the consistency coefficient and
   decreased the flow behavior index. A more compact and stable structure
   after combining quercetin was observed using SEM and TGA. The results of
   XRD and FT-IR identified that quercetin was bound to starch through
   hydrogen bonds, forming the non-inclusive complex with higher
   crystallinity. Compared with pregelatinized Tartary buckwheat starch
   (pre-TBS), the digestion rate of both pre-TBS-P and pre-TBS-P-Q
   decreased. The velocity constant in the first-order digestion ranked as
   pre-TBS < pre-TBS-P < pre-TBS-P-Q. Conclusively, using the combination
   of plasma treatment and complexation with quercetin, the digestion
   velocity of pre-TBS-P-Q complex decreased due to the increased viscosity
   of starch solution, as well as, the enhanced crystallinity and
   compactness of starch granules.

AB Metal phosphide has been widely exploited in the field of energy storage
   and catalysis instead of chemical sensors. In this work, Ni-Co-P hollow
   nanobricks (HNBs) was developed via template synthesis method followed
   by etching and phosphating treatments. The hierarchical morphology and
   composition of the Ni-Co-P HNBs were respectively characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen
   sorption analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High
   sensitivity (- 3.6 k omega / % RH), low hysteresis (- 3% RH) and good
   repeatability were achieved in a wide moisture range from 0% RH to 97.5%
   RH. By adjusting the ratio of Ni and Co, humidity sensing performance
   can be efficiently modulated. The optimal humidity sensing properties
   were attained at a ratio of Ni and Co of 1:5. Finally, the as-prepared
   sensor demonstrates great capability in respiratory analysis and
   noncontact human-machine interfacing. This work opens up a new paradigm
   for developing high-performance wearable sensing devices.

AB The extant literature suggests that digital technologies (big data
   analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain) help firms gain a
   competitive advantage. However, the studies do not focus on the micro,
   small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector. Moreover, MSMEs face various
   challenges, including significant supply chain disruption due to the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, there was an urgent requirement to shift to
   digital technologies to survive during this difficult time. In the
   context of MSME, various positive changes are discussed in the recent
   literature. However, a dearth of studies discusses the role of big data
   analytics capabilities (BDAC) to gain sustainable competitive advantage
   (SCA). Our study aims to fill this gap and answer this question - How do
   BDAC help MSMEs gain SCA? To understand the phenomenon, we receive
   theoretical support from organizational information processing theory
   (OIPT) and institutional theory (IT). We develop a conceptual framework
   that links BDAC and SCA through supply chain coordination, swift trust,
   and supply chain risk. Additionally, the age and size of the firm are
   used as control variables. The data is collected from Indian service
   sector employees of MSMEs, resulting in 497 usable responses. We use
   PLS-SEM using Warp PLS 7.0 to test the hypotheses. A critical finding is
   that the BDAC indirectly impacts the SCA. Finally, the other findings,
   limitations, and scope for future research are discussed.

   homogeneously dispersed in the CPF ternary film matrices, thereby
   filling void spaces in the composite matrix, and significantly improving
   the bio-nanocomposite films tensile properties (from 28.33 +/- 2.17 MPa
   to 33.0 +/- 1.28 MPa) (p < 0.05). However, the water barrier properties
   and water contact angle of the CPF films were not significantly
   influenced by the nanofiller embedding. Although the incorporation of
   the NPs decreased the light transmittance of the films, it provided the
   CPF-CCNPs nanocomposite films with excellent UV-barrier properties.
   ATR/FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated the
   formation of hydrogen bonds between the NPs and polymer mole-cules. TGA
   and DSC studies revealed that CPF-CCNPs nanocomposite films presented
   better thermal stability than the neat CPF film. AFM imaging also
   indicated a re-organization of the surface of the nanocomposite films
   due to the incorporation of the NPs. Release studies suggested that the
   CPF-CCNPs bionanocomposite film exhibited sustained release behavior of
   CIN. Likewise, the bioactive nanocomposites displayed antibacterial
   activity against food-borne pathogens such as Gram-positive
   (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes) and Gram-negative
   bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis). The
   bionanocomposite films exhibited in vitro DPPH radical scavenging
   activity (similar to 16.4%) and ferric reducing power at the maximum CIN
   loading con-centration. Additionally, analysis of storage quality
   indices (pH, TBARS values, color, and microbiological an-alyses)
   revealed the shelf-life of rainbow trout fillets wrapped in
   CPF-CCNPs0.25 was extended to 12 days.

AB A high-performance piezoelectric photocatalyst (V-BiOIO3/FTCN) was
   constructed to improve removal efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride
   (TCH). The role of V-BiOIO3 in the composite was to introduce
   piezoelectric effect and construct S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst
   with fish scale tubular carbon nitride (FTCN). The morphology,
   structure, chemical composition and optoelectronic characteristics of
   the as-prepared photo -catalysts were studied by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and
   UV-Vis DRS. Combined with UV-Vis DRS, XPS valence band, Mott-schottky
   curve and theoretical calculations, the mechanism of TCH degradation was
   deeply analyzed. A series of degradation experiments showed that the
   V-BiOIO3/FTCN could effectively degrade TCH, and the removal efficiency
   was further improved under the action of ultrasound. Importantly, the
   further immobilized V-BiOIO3/FTCN/MS could float on the water surface to
   degrade TCH without additional stirring, which facilitated the recovery
   of photocatalysts and showed excellent practical application value. This
   work provided a reference for the design and immobilization of carbon
   nitride-based piezoelectric photocatalysts.

AB In this research literature, a tungsten disulfide/iron cobaltite
   (WS2/FeCo2O4) interwoven construction array was prepared by a simplistic
   hydrothermal approach on Ni foam as an integrative electrode for
   supercapacitors (SCs). For characterization of the wearing of WS2
   nanostructure on FeCo2O4 nanosheets (WS2/FeCo2O4) by the Scanning
   electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The
   WS2/FeCo2O4 nanosheets supply a larger surface region and sufficient
   space to allow for volume changes. Moreover, considerable features of
   wellbeing conductivity from the Ni foam conductor and the synergistic
   procedures between WS2 and FeCo2O4, the integrated WS2/FeCo2O4 composite
   achieved prominent SCs storage performances with a higher specific
   capacity of 1122C g(-1) (2492.9F g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1) and notable
   capacity retention of 98.1% at 3 A g(-1) after 5000 long cycles and
   retained higher rate capacity of 951.9 C g(-1) at 15 A g(-1). For
   practical application, an asymmetric supercapacitors type
   WS2/FeCo2O4//active carbon (WS2/FeCo2O4//AC) device was successfully
   prepared. The WS2/FeCo2O4//AC device displays a higher specific capacity
   of 110C g(-1) and energy density of 85.68Wh kg(-1) at power density at
   897.65Wkg(-1), as well as the superior initial capacitance of 98.7% with
   cyclic stabilities after 4000 long cycles. Thus, these results indicated
   the great potential of the constructed WS2/FeCo2O4//AC in the scenario
   electrochemical properties due to their outstanding energy storage
   activities. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Green-synthesized nanobiomaterials can be engineered as smart

   medicine. Herein, we investigated the bioengineering of silver
   nanoparticles (AgNPs) and evaluated their physicochemical,
   antibacterial, biofilm inhibitory, anticoagulant, and antioxidant
   perfor-mance. Characterization of the AgNPs was performed utilizing
   UV-visible, transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering
   (DLS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The
   spherical shaped AgNPs were proven by TEM and SEM techniques. Moreover,
   the XRD diffraction patterns demonstrated that the nanoparticles were in
   a crystalline state. The DLS represented the hydrodynamic particle size
   of the NPs at 49.62 nm at a pH of 9. The calculated minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIC) of AgNPs toward Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923)
   was 8 mu g mL-1, which was almost similar to tetracycline by the value
   of 4 mu g mL-1. Moreover, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)
   of AgNPs was 64 mu g mL-1, which was significantly less than the
   determined value of 256 mu g mL-1 for tetracycline. Considering the
   pathogenic and standard S. aureus, the evaluated concentrations of AgNPs
   and tetracycline showed significant biofilm inhibitory performance.
   Furthermore, the bioengineered AgNPs exhibited significant anticoagulant
   activity at 500 mu g mL(-1) compared to saline (P < 0.001). In addition,
   the biogenic AgNPs inhibited 69.73 +/- 0.56% of DPPH free radicals at
   500 mu g mL(-1), indicating considerable antioxidant potential.

AB Global warming and noise pollution have emerged as the most serious
   environmental problems ever to confront humanity. In recent years, the
   use of natural fibers as thermal insulation and sound absorption
   construction materials has received much attention. Sugarcane bagasse
   waste (SBW) is an agro-industrial by-product, abundantly produced in
   sugar processing plants. Endowed with intrinsic surface roughness, SBW
   fibers are expected to exhibit high thermal and acoustic performance. To
   this end, SBW as an eco-friendly material was used to fabricate fibrous
   samples of different densities and thicknesses. The thermal insulation
   and sound absorption performance of the specimens were investigated
   using the guarded hot plate and impedance tube techniques, respectively.
   Additionally, the surface morphology and tensile properties of the SBW
   fibers were investigated using the FE-SEM and universal tensile tester.
   The thermal conductivity values of the specimens were found to range
   between 0.034 and 0.042 W/mK. The sound absorption average (SAA) and
   noise reduction coefficient (NRC) of the prepared samples were between
   0.26-0.64 and 0.27-0.62, respectively. The results pointed to the good
   performance of the SBW fibers in the low- and mid-frequency ranges. The
   acoustic characteristics of the specimens were also studied by the
   Johnson-Champoux-Allard and statistical models and good agreement with
   experimental data was noticed. It was concluded that SBW as an
   innovative sustainable construction material provides competitive
   performance in terms of thermal and acoustical characteristics compared
   with its natural and nonrenewable counterparts.

AB This paper synthesized a new type of ternary piezoelectric catalyst MoOX
   /ZnS/ZnO (MZZ) by a one-step method. The catalytic degradation of
   Rhodamine B (RhB) solution (10 mu g/g, pH = 7.0) shows that the
   composite catalyst has excellent piezoelectric catalytic activity under
   ultrasonic vibration (40 kHz). The piezoelectric degradation rate of the
   optimal sample reached 0.054 min(-1) , which was about 2.5 times that of
   pure ZnO. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS), Raman, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
   technologies were used to analyze the structure, morphology, and
   interface charge transfer properties of the MZZ piezocatalysts. The
   results showed that the composite catalyst may have a core-shell
   structure. ZnS is coated on the surface of ZnO, while MoOX adheres to
   the surface of ZnS. This structure endowed MZZ larger specific surface
   area than ZnO, which benefits the RhB adsorption. More importantly, the
   formed heterojunction structure between ZnS and ZnO promotes the
   separation of positive and negative charges induced by the piezoelectric
   effect. MoOX species may act as a charge trap to further promote more
   carriers to participate in the reaction. In addition, MoOX may also be
   beneficial in adsorbing dyes. Active species capture experiments show
   that superoxide radicals and holes are the main active species in
   piezoelectric catalytic reactions on MZZ catalysts. (c) 2022 The

   reinforced with elastic compression straps and secured with a polyester
   fabric of tight mesh size. The cotton pads were doped with a wound
   healing biocomposite, composed of chitosan, glycogen, and ZnO
   nanoparticles (CG@ZnONPs) previously formulated through a green process.
   The size of ZnONPs in the prepared CG@ZnONPs was 30-80 nm. The cotton
   pads impregnated with the CG@ZnONPs nanocomposite were characterized
   using FTIR, SEM, EDX, TGA, and DTGA methods. Moreover, the prepared
   dressings were tested on a number of intentionally injured rats. In this
   experiment, the % contraction of the treated wounds was monitored and
   compared to that of a control group of wounded rats, to which only
   sterile gauzes were applied. The results showed a much faster and an
   almost complete healing of rats treated with the synthesized dressings
   and the results were further confirmed by histopathological examination.
   The dressings were also found to exert a significant antimicrobial
   activity against a number of pathogenic microorganisms, generally
   encountered in common wounds, and could therefore be recommended to be a
   novel biomedical application for a fast, successful, and flawless wounds
   healing process.

AB The purpose of this research was to investigate the doxorubicin (DOX)
   adsorption behavior on Fe3O4@Ag-Metal Organic Framework (Fe3O4@Ag-MOF).
   This adsorbent was effectively prepared using a simple synthetic
   process. Many instruments, including FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS, were
   used to characterized the new Fe3O4@Ag-MOF. Additionally, the presented
   Fe3O4@Ag-surface MOF's area was shown to be 586.06 m2/g with a size of
   around 43 nm. The composite that was made has magnetic properties that
   were quite strong (63.3 emu/g). The produced Fe3O4@Ag-MOF was discovered
   to have a fantastic ability to adsorb the anti-cancer drug DOX, with a
   1.72 mmol/g (934.85 mg/g) adsorption capacity. On the basis of changes
   in temperature, pH, and DOX concentration, the DOX adsorption behavior
   mechanism was investigated. The adsorption capacity of Fe3O4@Ag-MOF for
   DOX was greater at pH 7.0, according to experimental data. The
   adsorption equilibrium also demonstrated that the Langmuir adsorption
   was regulated the best fit to the extracted data compared with the other
   models. Additionally, the activation energy of adsorption for DOX onto
   Fe3O4@Ag-MOF was determined, indicating the chemisorption process. The
   adsorption kinetics was shown in the well-known kinetic model of the
   pseudo-second-order. The adsorption thermodynamic measurements were
   documented according to according to the enthalpy (Delta H degrees),
   entropy(Delta S degrees), and Gibbs free energy (Delta G degrees)
   parameters demonstrated that the reaction was endothermic and
   spontaneous thermodynamic. The adsorption of DOX onto Fe3O4@Ag-MOF from
   real water samples (tap water, effluent wastewater, and influence
   wastewater) were investigated. It's interesting that the synthetic
   adsorbent had great recyclability 72.6 percent in the fifth cycle
   indicating that it was highly recyclable. After adsorption, the typical
   Fe3O4@Ag-MOF XRD peak intensities and locations were mostly unchanged
   throughout adsorption indicates the crystalline phase remained steady.
   The results indicated that Fe3O4@Ag-MOF were a good candidate for
   adsorbing the DOX and treating wastewater.

AB A pH-sensitive chitosan/sepiolite clay/algae biocomposite (Chi/Sep/Alg)
   was fabricated to remove cationic (malachite green, MG) and anionic
   (remazol brilliant blue R, RBBR) dyes from aqueous. The characteristics
   of Chi/Sep/Alg biocomposite were investigated by pH(pzc),
   pH-potentiometric titration, CHNS, XRD, SEM-EDX, FTIR, and BET analyses.
   A Box-Behnken design (BBD) was adopted to optimize the adsorptive
   performance of the Chi/Sep/Alg biocomposite towards removal of MG and
   RBBR dyes using three controllable operating factors, namely Chi/Sep/Alg
   dose (0.02-0.1 g), solution pH (4-8), and process time (5-30 min). The
   ideal BBD model circumstances for MG dye removal efficiency were as
   follows: Chi/Sep/Alg dose (0.1 g/L), solution pH 8, and time (17.5 min),
   while for RBBR dye, the ideal circumstances were Chi/Sep/Alg dose (0.1
   g/L), pH -4, and time (17.5 min). The adsorption kinetic and isotherm
   reflect that the adsorption of MG and RBBR dyes onto Chi/Sep/Alg
   biocomposite obeyed pseudo-second-order and Freundlich isotherm model,
   respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities of Chi/Sep/Alg
   biocomposite towards MG (515.7 mg/g) at basic pH environment (pH 8) and
   RBBR (292.4 mg/g) at acidic pH environment (pH 4). An endothermic and
   spontaneous adsorption process of MG and RBBR dyes was confirmed by the
   calculated thermodynamic functions. The adsorption mechanism of MG and
   RBBR dyes on the surface of Chi/Sep/Alg biocomposite can be attributed
   to various interactions such as electrostatic, H-bonding, and n-pi
   interactions. Thus, this pH-sensitive Chi/Sep/Alg biocomposite exhibits
   a great affinity towards capturing cationic and anionic dyes by

   sustainable karaya gum for water treatment. Karaya gum crosslink
   poly(acrylamide-co-acrylonitrile) @ silver nanoparticle
   (KG-cl-P(AAm-co-AN) @AgNPs) HNC were made by an aqueous free radical in
   situ crosslink copolymerization of acrylamide (AAm) and acrylic acid
   (AA) in aqueous solution of KG-stabilized AgNPs. FTIR, XRD, DTA-TGA,
   SEM, and TEM were used to characterize HNC. The hydrogels' swelling,
   diffusion, and network characteristics were investigated. The removal
   efficiency of HNC was found to be 99% at pH 8 for a crystal violet (CV),
   dose of 0.02 g after 1 h. Dye adsorption by these hydrogels was also
   investigated in terms of isotherms, and kinetics. The dye's
   exceptionally high adsorption capacity on HNC for CV removal is
   explained by H-bonding interactions, as well as dipole-dipole and
   electrostatic interactions between anionic adsorbent and cationic dye
   molecules (Qmax, 1000 mg/g). The HNC can be regenerated with 0.1 M HCl
   and reused at least 10 times maintaining over 68% dye removal. The
   loading of AgNPs into the polymeric matrix of KG-cl-P(AAm-co-AN)
   significantly increases the removal percentage of CV dye from its
   aqueous solution, according to this study.

AB Biochar was used as a heterogeneous activator for peroxymonosulfate
   (PMS), and the activation performance strongly depended on the
   structure, functional groups, and modification of the biochar. In this
   study, a new type of modified biochar was synthesized by utilizing the
   Mn(II) adsorption capacity of bacteria. After one-step py-rolysis of
   Mn(II)-adsorbed bacterial cells at 800 degrees C, a Mn-incorporated
   bacterial-derived biochar (Mn-BBC) was successfully produced. It
   exhibited structural heterogeneity, with MnO located at the surface of
   the BBC matrix, as shown on the result of SEM and XRD. Compared to BBC,
   Mn-BBC showed a 10-fold increase (0.0727 min(-1) versus 0.0069 min(-1))
   of pollutant removal rate. In addition, it also showed anti-interference
   capacity against common water matrix (except 10 mM CO32-) and great
   stability/reusability. Chemical quenching, electron spin resonance, and
   pyrophosphate trapping indicated an indirect but important role of the
   superoxide, formed during the self-decomposition of PMS. The MnO on
   Mn-BBC can be oxidized by superoxide to produce surface Mn (III), which
   then binds to PMS and forms a surface complex. This complex promotes
   electron transfer from the pollutant to the Mn-BBC, facilitating the
   oxidation of the contaminants. Overall, this study confirmed the PMS
   activation capacity and mechanism of Mn-BBC, which expands the
   application of BBC-based materials derived from metal-adsorbed microbes.

AB Municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWIFA), as a hazardous
   solid waste, contains such toxic substances as heavy metals and dioxin,
   making its disposal a global public health concern. This study aims to
   comprehensively combine solid waste red mud (RM), carbide slag (CS), and
   MSWIFA into eco-friendly geopolymer. This experiment used CS slurry and
   RM slurry without drying and grinding, effectively reducing energy
   consumption and cost. The mechanical and environmental properties of
   geopolymer were characterized by strength, chloride ion curing rate, and
   leaching concentration of heavy metals. The microscopic hydration
   mechanism of the binder was investigated using XRD, FTIR, TG-DTG, SEM +
   EDS, and MIP tests. The results show that when RM: CS: MSWIFA = 5: 2: 3,
   the 28 d compressive strength can reach 11.7 MPa, the chloride ion
   curing rate is 80.41%, and leaching levels of toxic substances are lower
   than the limits for landfill disposal regulated by the China standard
   (GB16889-2008). The Al-O and Si-O chemical bonds in RM were broken in
   the alkaline environment provided by CS and MSWIFA, and formed hydrate
   calcium chloroaluminate (HCC) and C-S-H gel with calcium ions and
   chloride ions. These hydration products can fill pores and reduce
   porosity, making the pores in the structure mainly gel micropores and
   mesopores with volume fractions of 10.3 and 68.1% respectively. This
   study expands the application of a new waste alkaline activator in
   alkaline activation and provides methods for MSWIFA solidification.

AB The complete characteristics knowledge of clay minerals is necessary in
   the evaluation studies of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Ten samples taken from
   two wells in a heterogeneous clastic gas reservoir formation in NE Iran
   were selected to conduct the transmission Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) tests for the clay mineralogy studies. The FTIR
   analysis showed that there were clear signs of clay minerals in all
   samples. The wavenumber region of the clay minerals in FTIR tests was
   detected to be 3621, 3432, 1034, and 515 cm(-1) for illite, 3567, 3432,
   1613, 1088, 990, 687, 651, and 515 cm(-1) for magnesium-rich chlorite,
   3700, 3621, 3432, 1034, 687, and 463 cm(-1) for kaolinite, and 3567,
   1088, 990, and 463 cm(-1) for glauconite. After screening of samples by
   the FTIR method, the samples were then analyzed by powder X-ray
   diffraction (PXRD), wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF),
   and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The PXRD and SEM result showed
   illite was by far the most common clay present. Kaolinite,
   magnesium-rich chlorite, and traces of smectite and the mixed-layer
   clays of both the illite-smectite and chlorite-smectite types were also
   recognized. The combination of PXRD and WDXRF results could quantify the
   clay abundances in the each well too. It was concluded that the FTIR
   analysis successfully could show the absorption bonds of all constituent
   clays. However, the infrared absorption spectra of mixed-layer clays
   overlapped those of the respective constituents of each mixed-layer
   minerals. This can be considered as the evidence of the usefulness of
   FTIR technique in the screening of the samples for the clay mineralogy
   studies.

AB Objectives: Lithium-based glass-ceramics are currently dominating the
   landscape of dental restorative ceramic materials, with new products
   taking the market by storm in the last years. Though, the difference
   among all these new and old products is not readily accessible for the
   practitioner, who faces the dilemma of reaching a blind choice or
   trusting manufacturers' marketing brochures. To add confusion, new
   compositions tend to wear material terminologies inherited from vanguard
   dental lithium disilicates, disregarding accuracy. Here we aim to
   characterize such materials for their microstructure, crystalline
   fraction, glass chemistry and mechanical properties. Methods: Eleven
   commercial dental lithium-based glass ceramics were evaluated: IPS e.max
   (R) CAD, IPS e.max (R) Press, Celtra (R) Duo, Suprinity (R) PC,
   InitialTM LiSi Press, InitialTM LiSi Block, Amber (R) Mill, Amber (R)
   Press, N!CE (R), Obsidian (R) and CEREC TesseraTM. The chemical
   composition of their base glasses was measured by X-Ray Fluorescence
   Spectroscopy (XRF) and Inductive Coupled Plasma Optical Emission
   Spectroscopy (ICPOES), as well as the composition of their residual
   glass by subtracting the oxides bound in the crystallized fraction,
   characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinement, and
   quantified accurately using the G-factor method (QXRD). The
   crystallization behavior is revealed by differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) curves. Elastic constants are provided from Resonant
   Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) and the fracture toughness measured by the
   Ball-on-Three-Balls method (B3B- K Ic). The microstructure is revealed
   by fieldemission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Results: The
   base glasses showed a wide range of SiO2 /Li2O ratios, from 1.5 to 3.0,
   with the degree of depolymerization dropping from 1/2 to 2/3 of the
   initial connectivity. Materials contained Li2SiO3+Li3PO4,
   Li2SiO3+Li3PO4+Li2Si2O5, Li2Si2O5+Li3PO4+ Cristobalite and/or Quartz and
   Li2Si2O5+Li3 PO4+LiAlSi2O6, in crystallinity degrees from 45 to 80 vol%.
   Crystalline phases could be traced to their crystallization peaks on the
   DSC curves. Pressable materials and IPS e.max (R) CAD were the only
   material showing micrometric phases, with N!CE (R) and InitialTM LiSi
   Block showing solely nanometric crystals, with the rest presenting a
   mixture of submicrometric and nanometric particles. Fracture toughness
   from 1.45 to 2.30 MPa root m were measured, with the linear correlation
   to crystalline fraction breaking down for submicrometric and nanometric
   crystal phases. Significance: Dental lithium-based silicate
   glass-ceramics cannot be all put in the same bag, as differences exist
   in chemical composition, microstructure, crystallinity and mechanical
   properties. Pressable materials still perform better mechanically than
   CAM/CAM blocks, which loose resistance to fracture when crystal phases
   enter the submicrometric and na-nometric range (c) 2021 The Academy of

AB In this work, nanoscale hydroxyapatite (HAP)-modified ZIF-67 composite,
   HAP/ZIF-67, with abundant functional groups for uranium(VI) binding was
   synthesized via a facile ultrasound-assisted synthesis method. The
   prepared HAP/ZIF-67 was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, FT-IR and
   XPS techniques, and was applied to eliminate uranium(VI) from aqueous
   solutions under various conditions, i.e., pH, coexisting ions,
   temperature and contact time. The results indicate that the abundant
   Co-OH, -C=N- and -NH- binding groups originating from the ZIF-67 and the
   Ca-OH and PO43- derived from loaded nanoscale HAP synergistically
   endowed HAP/ZIF-67 with the excellent U(VI) adsorption capacity of 453.1
   mg/g, which is 2.55 and 1.78 times that of pristine HAP and ZIF-67.
   HAP/ZIF-67 showed high adsorption selectivity toward U(VI), and the
   U(VI) elimination efficiency for real wastewater by HAP/ZIF-67 reached
   97.29%. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were well simulated by the
   pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm model, respectively,
   suggesting that U(VI) adsorption was an endothermic monolayer
   chemisorption process. The adsorption mechanism of U (VI) by HAP/ZIF-67
   was dominated by surface complexation process. This work is expected to
   provide an effective strategy for developing HAP-modified MOFs absorbent
   to be used for the highly efficient elimination of radionuclides from
   wastewater.

AB In this work, tapered/etched multicore fiber (MCF) probes are spliced
   with multimode fiber (MMF) to fabricate the sensor structure. To improve
   sensitivity, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and molybdenum disulfide
   nanoparticles (MoS2-NPs) are used to immobilize both probes. Synthesized
   AuNPs and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)-nanoparticles (NPs) have peak
   absorption wavelengths of 519 and 330 nm, respectively. High-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy is used to examine the morphology of
   the NPs. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is used to characterize
   the NP-immobilized optical fiber sensor structures, and SEM-EDX is used
   to verify the NP-coating over fiber structure. The functionalization of
   the acetylcholinesterase enzyme over the NP-immobilized probe increases
   the specificity of the sensor later on. Finally, the developed sensor
   probes are tested by detecting various acetylcholine concentrations. In
   addition, performance analyses, such as reusability, reproducibility,
   and selectivity (in the presence of ascorbic acid, glucose, dopamine,
   and uric acid), are carried out, and proposed biosensors are
   experimentally evaluated. The developed tapered fiber sensor with a

AB With the ever-increasing attention to eco-friendly flame-retardant
   finishing of cotton fabrics (CF), bio-based flame retardants have been
   urgently required. For this end, laccase (QM) and phytic acid (PA) were
   fabricated on CF via layer-by-layer self assembly. The successful
   deposition of binary coating on CF was characterized by FTIR and
   SEM-EDS. With the aid of biomass coating, the LOI value of CF/QM/PA was
   largely elevated to 43.0% with an increment of 129% as compared to
   pristine CF. Moreover, CF/QM/PA displayed self extinguishing phenomenon
   upon removing the fire during the vertical burning tests, and the peak
   heat release rate (PHRR) of CF/QM/PA was remarkably dropped to 36 W/g
   from 310 W/g of CF with a reduction of 88.4%. Thermogravimetric analysis
   (TG) revealed that although the maximum thermal degradation rate of
   CF/QM/PA significantly reduced as compared to CF, the final char residue
   reached up to 39.0%. More importantly, in combination of the analyses of
   the gaseous products generated during the combustion process and the
   residual chars after combustion, it was proposed that QM/PA coating
   exerted flame-retardant activities both in the condensed phase and gas
   phase. Generally, this work provides a feasible and eco-friendly method
   for the flameretardant finishing of cotton fabrics.

AB Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an unprecedented crisis for
   businesses. The small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been impacted
   even more, due to their limited resources. Extant literature has
   prescribed many treatments on how SMEs could survive in post COVID-19
   situation, but studies did not analyse how big data driven innovation
   could improve supply chain management (SCM) process in the post COVID-19
   pandemic under the moderating influence of SME technology leadership
   support. Thus, there is a research gap in this important domain. The aim
   of this study is to examine the impact of big data driven innovation and
   technology capability of the SME on its supply chain system. The study
   also investigates the moderating role of SME technology leadership
   support on SME performance in the post COVID-19 scenario. With the help
   of literature and resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capability view
   (DCV) theory, a theoretical model has been developed conceptually. Later
   the model is validated using structural equation modelling (SEM)
   technique with 327 usable respondents from SMEs from India. The study
   found that both big data driven innovation and the techno-functional
   capability of SME impacts supply chain capability which in turn impacts
   the SME performance in the post COVID-19 scenario. The study also finds
   that there will be a moderating impact of SME technology leadership
   support on SME performance.

   assess the pore connectivity and heterogeneity, respectively. In this
   study, multifractal analysis was performed on over-mature
   Wufeng-Longmaxi shales and their corresponding isolated organic matter
   (OM) via gas physisorption (CO2 and N-2) test to ascertain the pore
   heterogeneity and its governing factors. Micropore (diameter<2 nm)
   structure in bulk shale contains stronger pore heterogeneity but weaker
   connectivity than meso-macropore (diameter = 2-100 nm) structure. The
   comparison of heterogeneity features of shale versus its isolated OM
   reveals that micropore associated with minerals could enhance the
   micropore heterogeneity in bulk shale, while meso-macmpore existing in
   minerals could reduce the meso-macmpore heterogeneity in bulk shale.
   Besides, the total organic carbon content has a positive effect on the
   micropore heterogeneity. The micropore and meso-macmpore volume have a
   certain impact on the pore heterogeneity in the corresponding pore size
   ranges. Compared with the low-mature Bakken shale, the over-mature
   Wufeng-Longmaxi shale contains the stronger micropore heterogeneity but
   weaker meso-macmpore heterogeneity, where less difference between the
   micropore and meso-macropore heterogeneities was also observed. We
   deduced that the whole shale pore spectrum likely tends to be
   homogeneous along with the OM thermal maturation.

AB This research investigated the role of adding bio toughener and
   reinforcements in the process of making biocomposite for sustainable
   engineering applications. The primary aim of this study was to develop a
   biocomposite material using agricultural waste and validate the
   performance of the composite prepared. The areca fiber was procured from
   a fiber firm, while the rice husk ash (RHA) biochar and cardanol oil
   (CO) were prepared by low-temperature pyrolysis and Soxhlet extraction
   respectively. The areca fiber was surface-treated by alkali-silane
   through hydrolysis process. The biocomposites were prepared using hand
   the layup method, followed by curing at elevated temperature. The
   composites underwent testing as per the American Society for Testing and
   Materials (ASTM) standards. According to the mechanical properties, the
   addition of cardinal oil to the resin improved the toughening effect
   along with areca fiber and biochar. Highest tensile strength of 208 MPa,
   flexural strength of 236 MPa, and Izod impact toughness of 7.2 J were
   noted for composite designation NC3. The wear properties of cardanol
   oil-toughened epoxy resin composites showed a downtrend; however,
   further addition of biochar particle of 1 vol.% improved the coefficient
   of friction (COF) and sp. wear rate. Similarly, the fatigue behavior of
   composite designation NC3 showed the highest life counts of 50,622 for
   50% of ultimate tensile stress (UTS) at 3 Hz. The scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) fractograph images revealed improved adhesion for fiber
   to resin and the trace for toughness improvement. These high toughness
   epoxy biocomposites made using agricultural waste-derived reinforcements
   could be sustainable, cost-effective, and environment-friendly and used
   as an alternate material in structural, defense, automotive, and drone
   applications.

AB The main objective of the present study was to produce biodiesel from
   waste cooking oil (WCO) in the presence of Candida Antarctica Lipase B
   (CALB), which was immobilized on a magnetic hybrid sol-gel
   nanocomposite. For this purpose, the Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles
   synthesized by the co-precipitation technique and were coated with
   silica (SiO2) and then functionalized with organic-inorganic hybrid
   tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and N[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]
   ethylenediamine (TSD). Subsequently, the synthesized and modified
   magnetic nanoparticle was characterized by using X-ray Diffraction
   (XRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Vibrating-Sample
   Magnetometer (VSM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Energy
   Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The optimized condition of the lipase
   immobilization was in lipase concentration of 2.5 mg mL-1,
   immobilization time of 5 h, immobilization temperature of 35 degrees C,
   and pH of 7. The thermal stability of the immobilized lipase was greatly
   increased compared to the free enzyme. The effect of operating
   parameters including reaction temperature (30-70 degrees C),
   methanol/oil (M/O) molar ratio (1:1-5:1), contact time (12-36 h), and
   catalyst dosage (0.2-1 g) was evaluated in terms of biodiesel production
   yield. Based on the results, the maximum yield of biodiesel using the
   synthesized biocatalyst was 96%, at a temperature of 40 degrees C, M/O
   molar ratio of 4:1, contact time of 30 h, and catalyst dosage of 1 g.
   The obtained results indicated that the synthesized biocatalyst can be
   used as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production in
   accordance with the fuel standard (ASTM D6751).

AB Sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) was firstly adopted as a green and low
   toxic additive in molten salt medium to produce S enriched biochar
   (STBC) for the effectively heavy metal adsorption from aqueous system.
   The decomposition of Na2S2O3 could create abundant porous structures,
   introducing rich S surface motifs and persevering amounts of mineral
   species in the as-produced biochar. Batch adsorption tests with sorption
   kinetics and isotherms analyses prove that the STBC demonstrates the
   maximum adsorption capacity (Q(m)) of 421.8 and 185.0 mg/g for Pb(II)
   and Cu(II), which are much enhanced than the unmodified biochar and the
   biochars prepared with other sulfur-containing additives (Na2S, Na2SO3
   or Na2SO4). In addition, the column tests indicates that STBC also shows
   great efficiency to remove multiple heavy metals from the simulated
   wastewater. Detailed mechanism measurements and DFT calculation indicate
   the enhanced sorption performance mainly derived from the chemical
   adsorption due to the strong binding effects of the sulfurous functional
   groups, and joint effects of physical adsorption and ion exchange.
   Thanks to the green and facile producing procedure, this method could
   potentially serve as a versatile strategy to yield biochars with high
   adsorption performances in heavy metal ion removal.

   perceptionbased influence factors of BPT adoption in an innovation
   diffusion framework. A structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis is

   Central Punjab province (Pakistan). These questionnaire-based data are
   collected using random and convenience sampling techniques. The main
   results are: first, relative advantage, trialability, and observability
   are revealed to significantly drive BPT adoption, while compatibility
   and complexity impede the adoption process. Second, the relative
   advantage turns up the highest-ranked, whereas observability manifests
   itself as the lowest-ranked factor. Third, the relative advantage and
   compatibility emerge as the leading driver and bottleneck of BPT
   adoption, respectively. In closing, policies involving quality
   enhancement and efficiency improvement of BPT, local market development,
   the incentivization of households, and the introduction of some schemes
   to mitigate the investment risk in BPT are recommended.

AB Water pollution endangers water sustainability; it limits the quantity
   of water available for consumption. Therefore, poor quality of water
   resources warrants significant ecological and public health concerns.
   Hence, there is a need for efficient materials and methods for water
   treatment. In this work, efficient membranes were synthesized by
   integrating amine-modified graphene in polyamide of m-phenylenediamine
   and trimesoyl chloride. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy
   dispersive x-ray (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   and atomic force microscope (AFM) analyses were used for the
   characterization of the morphology, and surface characteristics and
   structure, of the prepared membranes. Filtration experiments were
   performed to examine the permeability and separation capacity of the
   membrane against organic contaminants, heavy metals, and salts. The
   obtained results displayed that permeability of salts and metal ions and
   separation of oil were considerably improved by integrating the
   membranes with amine-modified graphene. The synthesized membranes
   displayed hydrocarbon separation efficiency of ti 100%, total metal ions
   rejection of up to 96%, and average salt rejection of around 80%. The
   proposed membranes are very promising for real-world applications
   because of their outstanding stability, high flux, rejection of salt,
   and rejection of oil. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots have received considerable
   attention during the last few years. However, little is known concerning
   what affects their use for educational purposes. This research,
   therefore, develops a theoretical model based on extracting constructs
   from the expectation confirmation model (ECM) (expectation confirmation,
   perceived usefulness, and satisfaction), combined with the knowledge
   management (KM) factors (knowledge sharing, knowledge acquisition, and
   knowledge application) to understand the sustainable use of chatbots.
   The developed model was then tested based on data collected through an
   online survey from 448 university students who used chatbots for
   learning purposes. Contrary to the prior literature that mainly relied
   on structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, the empirical data
   were analyzed using a hybrid SEM-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN)
   approach. The hypotheses testing results reinforced all the suggested
   hypotheses in the developed model. The sensitivity analysis results
   revealed that knowledge application has the most considerable effect on
   the sustainable use of chatbots with 96.9% normalized importance,
   followed by perceived usefulness (70.7%), knowledge acquisition (69.3%),
   satisfaction (61%), and knowledge sharing (19.6%). Deriving from these
   results, the study highlighted a number of practical implications that
   benefit developers, designers, service providers, and instructors.

   to create an efficient carriers in drug delivery systems (DDSs). The
   three samples (i.e., pure MCM-41, NH2/MCM-41, and CUR@NH2/MCM-41) were
   characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
   (BET) surface area, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (EDX), transition electron microscopy (TEM), and a thermogravimetric
   analyzer (TGA). The study investigated the effect of the carrier dose,
   CUR concentration, pH, and contact time on the drug loading efficiency
   (DLE%) by adsorption. The best DLE% for MCM-41 and NH2/MCM-41 was found
   to be 15.78 and 80%, respectively. This data demonstrated that the
   Langmuir isotherm had a greater correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.9840
   for MCM-41 and 0.9666 for NH2/MCM-41 than the Freundlich and Temkin
   isotherm models. A pseudo-second-order kinetic model seems to fit well
   with R-2 = 0.9741 for MCM-41 and R-2= 0.9977 for NH2/MCM-41. A phosphate
   buffer solution (PBS) with a pH of 7.4 was utilized to study CUR release
   behavior. As a result, the full release after 72 h was found to have a
   maximum of 74.1% and 29.95% for pure MCM-41 and NH2/MCM-41,
   respectively. The first-order, Weibull, Hixson-Crowell,
   Korsmeyer-Peppas, and Higuchi kinetic release models were applied to
   releasing CUR from CUR@MCM-41 and CUR@NH2/MCM-41. The Weibull kinetic
   model fit well, with R-2 = 0.944 and 0.96912 for pure MCM-41 and
   NH2/MCM-41, respectively. (C) 2022 The Society of Powder Technology

AB For backfill projects in seasonally frozen regions, freeze-thaw and
   compaction are two critical factors that affect engineering safety by
   changing the soil structure. This study investigated the effects of
   freeze-thaw cycles on the microstructure characteristics of saline soil
   with different compaction degrees using mercury intrusion porosimetry
   (MIP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and laser particle size
   analysis (LPSA). The compacted soil samples show a bimodal pore size
   distribution (PSD). With an increase in the freeze-thaw cycles, the
   volume of intra-aggregate pores (<4 mu m) gradually decreases, while
   that of inter-aggregate pores (>4 mu m) varies with the density of soil
   samples. Furthermore, compaction has a decisive effect on the volume of
   inter-aggregate pores. Under the effect of freeze-thaw cycles, the void
   ratio of the low-density soil sample decreases, and the soil structure
   gradually becomes denser, showing thaw settlement deformation. However,
   in the high-density soil sample, the void ratio increases and the soil
   structure becomes loose, showing frost heaving deformation. Moreover,
   the freeze-thaw cycle also leads to the breakage of coarse particles and
   the aggregation of fine particles. Correspondingly, the soil structure
   type changes from a flocculent structure to a granular stacked structure
   and then to a cemented-aggregated structure. After 60 freeze-thaw
   cycles, the cracks are penetrated and the water migration channels are
   formed, the soil structures all reach a new equilibrium state.
   Meanwhile, the void ratios of different compacted soil samples are close
   to the same residual value. Test results suggest that there may be an
   optimal compaction degree between 90% and 95%, where the soil
   microstructure is least affected by freeze-thaw cycles. This study may
   provide theoretical guidance for the construction of backfill
   engineering projects in seasonally frozen regions from a
   micro-perspective.

AB Although N-doped porous carbon has been widely studied in CO2 capture
   and conversion, the preparation process of functionalized porous carbon
   is usually complicated and costly, which limits the large-scale
   industrial application of porous carbon. Here, we reported a
   straightforward method for the preparation of N-doped porous carbon
   using chitosan (CTS) and NaNH2 without any solvents. The structure of
   N-doped porous carbon was characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and pore
   structure analysis, respectively. The developed pore structure and
   specific surface area of N-doped porous carbon are mainly due to the use
   of NaNH2 as both porogen and nitrogen source during carbonization. These
   prepared porous carbons are used to study the adsorption of CO2, SO2,
   H2S and CH4. The adsorption capacity of CO2 can reach 6.33 mmol.g(-1) at
   273.15 K and 100 kPa, which is significantly higher than that of
   carbon-based adsorbents reported in the literature. The thermodynamics
   and mechanism of CO2 adsorption are also discussed. The results suggest
   that the adsorption of CO2 by N-doped porous carbon is a physical
   adsorption process. In addition, a metal-free conversion of CO2 into
   formamides is also acquired using N-doped porous carbon as promoter,
   giving various corresponding formamides in moderate to excellent yields.
   As a result, the excellent CO2 uptake, high reactivity, low cost of
   precursor, and facile synthesis strategy prove that these chitosan-based
   N-doped porous carbons are a potential candidate for CO2 capture and
   conversion.

AB Herein, the metabolites secreted by brown algae, Cystoseira crinita,
   were used as biocatalyst for green synthesis of magnesium oxide
   nanoparticles (MgO-NPs). The fabricated MgO-NPs were characterized using
   UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
   Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy
   linked with energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Data showed successful
   formation of crystallographic and spherical MgO-NPs with sizes of 3-18
   nm at a maximum surface plasmon resonance of 320 nm. Moreover, EDX
   analysis confirms the presence of Mg and O in the sample with weight
   percentages of 54.1% and 20.6%, respectively. Phyco-fabricated MgO-NPs
   showed promising activities against Gram-positive bacteria,
   Gram-negative bacteria, and Candida albicans with MIC values ranging
   between 12.5 and 50 mu g mL(-1). The IC50 value of MgO-NPs against
   cancer cell lines (Caco-2) was 113.4 mu g mL(-1), whereas it was 141.2
   mu g mL(-1) for normal cell lines (Vero cell). Interestingly, the green
   synthesized MgO-NPs exhibited significant larvicidal and pupicidal
   activity against Musca domestica. At 10 mu g mL(-1) MgO-NPs, the highest
   mortality percentages were 99.0%, 95.0%, 92.2%, and 81.0% for I, II, III
   instars' larvae, and pupa of M. domestica, respectively, with LC50
   values (3.08, 3.49, and 4.46 mu g mL(-1)), and LC90 values (7.46, 8.89,
   and 10.43 mu g mL(-1)), respectively. Also, MgO-NPs showed repellence
   activity for adults of M. domestica at 10 mu g mL(-1) with 63.0%, 77.9%,
   84.9%, and 96.8% after 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively.

AB The Sporosarcina pasteurii strains can grow and multiply in seawater
   medium and have certain urease activity. The two-phase and one-phase
   cementation methods can be used for the construction of ocean islands
   and reefs far away from the mainland in seawater seawater based MICP
   (Microbial-Induced Carbonate Precipitation). The compressive strength,
   carbonates content and porosity of sand blocks cemented by seawater
   based MICP with two-phase and one-phase methods are measured and
   compared. The results show that the strength and carbonates content of
   sand blocks with two-phase biocementation are greater than that of
   one-phase. The SEM images show that the principle of seawater based MICP
   cementing loose sand blocks is that carbonates particles grow between
   the sand particles, and them act as a bridge to bind the loose sand
   particles into a whole. The seawater based UPB of different pH can
   induce calcium carbonate deposition at different time. The seawater
   based UPB of different pH can be selected according to the actual
   project to reinforce the island reef sand foundation and prepare
   building materials under one-phase biocementation.

AB As an emerging pollutant, microplastics (MPs) may interact with
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) which is prevalent in the aqueous
   environment. Meanwhile, the aging of MPs in the actual environment
   increases the uncertainty of their environmental fate. Here, the
   interaction mechanisms between pristine and aged poly-propylene
   microplastics (PP-MPs) and humic acid (HA) at pH 7.0 were explored.
   Microstructural changes of HA were examined by fluorescence and Fourier
   transformation infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Atomic force micro-scopy
   coupled with infrared (AFM-IR) and micro-Raman techniques were used to
   characterize and analyze the interacted PP-MPs. The addition of HA
   increased the surface roughness of both pristine and aged PP-MPs.
   Results of AFM-IR and Raman spectra showed that the interaction of
   PP-MPs with HA accelerated their surface oxidation and enhanced the
   characteristic signals. XPS spectra showed that the oxygen content ratio
   of pristine and aged PP-MPs increased by 0.95% and 1.48% after the
   addition of HA, respectively. PP-MPs after aging interacted more
   strongly with HA and there was a higher affinity between them.
   Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D -COS) combined with FT-IR
   spectra further elucidated the interaction mechanism at the molecular
   level. This work will help to evaluate the environmental impact of MPs
   in ecosystems and understand their interactions with DOM.

AB This paper aims at obtaining a semi-analytical and semi-numerical 3D
   model of source-to-site seismic wave propagation due to kinematic
   finite-fault sources. To this end, a two-step procedure integrating the
   frequency-wavenumber (FK) approach with the spectral element method
   (SEM) is proposed based on the concept of domain reduction. First, the
   broadband responses of a stratified crust are accurately calculated by
   using a novel FK approach and are converted into effective seismic
   inputs around the region of interest. After that, the seismic wavefields
   at local and regional scales arising from complex geological and
   topographical conditions are finely simulated using the SEM, and a
   perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary condition is simultaneously
   applied to realize the absorption of outgoing waves. In this procedure,
   a hybrid source modelling scheme that combines the low-wavenumber
   deterministic and high-wavenumber stochastic components on the fault
   plane is introduced, effectively addressing the high-frequency motion
   radiated from the source rupture process. Subsequently, the proposed
   FK-SEM procedure is verified step-by-step using the point source and
   finite-fault source models. To illustrate the feasibility of the
   procedure, 3D physics-based numerical simulations (PBSs) of two seismic
   events, including a historical Sanhe-Pinggu earthquake and a
   well-recorded Yangbi earthquake, are performed. The case studies
   validate that the proposed FK-SEM procedure allows a significant
   reduction in computational effort and a substantial improvement in
   modelling resolution and can be applied to the source-to-site broadband
   synthetics of earthquake scenarios with limited resources. In addition,
   this coupled geophysics-engineering simulation meets the requirements of
   time-history analysis for engineering structures, which facilitates the
   study of soil-structure interactions and regional-scale building damage
   assessment.

AB In cement-based materials, alkalis mainly exist in the form of different
   alkali sulfates. In this study, the impacts of different alkali sulfates
   on the shrinkage, hydration, pore structure, fractal dimension and
   microstructure of low-heat Portland cement (LHPC), medium-heat Portland
   cement (MHPC) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) are investigated. The
   results indicate that alkali sulfates magnify the autogenous shrinkage
   and drying shrinkage of cement-based materials with different mineral
   compositions, which are mainly related to different pore structures and
   hydration processes. LHPC has the lowest shrinkage. Otherwise, the
   effect of alkali sulfates on the autogenous shrinkage is more profound
   than that of drying shrinkage. Compared with the pore size distribution,
   the fractal dimension can better characterize the shrinkage properties
   of cement-based materials. It is noted that the contribution of K2SO4 (K
   alkali) to the promotion effect of shrinkage on cement-based materials
   is more significant than that of Na2SO4 (Na alkali), which cannot be
   ignored. The microstructure investigation of different cement-based
   materials by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mercury
   intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) shows
   that this effect may be related to the different pore structures,
   crystal forms and morphologies of hydration products of cement-based
   materials.

AB Introduction: Fusarium graminearum is a most destructive fungal pathogen
   that causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease in cereal crops,
   resulting in severe yield loss and mycotoxin contamination in food and
   feed. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are extensively applied in multiple
   fields due to their strong anti-microbial activity and are considered
   alternatives to fungicides. However, the antifungal mechanisms and the
   effects of AgNPs on mycotoxin production have not been well
   characterized.Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the antifungal
   activity and mechanisms of AgNPs against both fungicide-resistant and
   fungicide-sensitive F. graminearum strains, determine their effects on
   mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) production, and evaluate the potential of
   AgNPs for FHB management in the field.Methods: Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
   fluores-cence microscopy were used to examine the fungal morphological
   changes caused by AgNPs. In addition, RNA-Seq, qRT-PCR, and western
   blotting were conducted to detect gene transcription and DON levels.
   Results: AgNPs with a diameter of 2 nm exhibited effective antifungal
   activity against both fungicide-sen-sitive and fungicide-resistant
   strains of F. graminearum. Further studies showed that AgNP application
   could impair the development, cell structure, cellular energy
   utilization, and metabolism pathways of this fungus. RNA-Seq analysis
   and sensitivity determination revealed that AgNP treatment significantly
   induced the expression of azole-related ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
   transporters without compromising the control efficacy of azoles in F.
   graminearum. AgNP treatment stimulated the generation of reactive oxygen
   species (ROS), subsequently induced transcription of DON biosynthesis
   genes, toxisome forma-tion, and mycotoxin production.Conclusion: This
   study revealed the underlying mechanisms of AgNPs against F.
   graminearum, determined their effects on DON production, and evaluated
   the potential of AgNPs for controlling fungicide-resistant F.
   graminearum strains. Together, our findings suggest that combinations of
   AgNPs with DON-reducing fungicides could be used for the management of
   FHB in the future.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on

AB A novel B,N-decorated carbocatalyst (Fe@BPC-XBN) for peroxymonosulfate
   (PMS) activation was prepared by a simple pyrolysis method using the
   iron-based metal organic frameworks (Fe-MOF), boric acid and boron
   nitride (BN) as precursors. Fe@BPC-20BN removed 93.3% of bisphenol A
   (BPA) in 90 mM compared to 64.9%, 82.1% and 83.5% with Fe@PC, Fe@BPC and
   Fe@PC-20BN, respectively, with 0.15 g/L catalyst and 1 mM PMS at initial
   pH of 7. The solo B-doping with boron acid on the Fe-MOF derived porous
   carbon enhanced its catalytic capacity; moreover, B, N co-doping with BN
   and boron acid as precursors further promoted the catalytic performance.
   The addition of BN not only provided more B, N catalytic centers but
   also improved the stability of the carbocatalyst. In addition, hydroxyl
   radicals, sulfate radicals, superoxide radicals, and singlet oxygen
   species were involved in the degradation of BPA. Fe species,
   -BCO2/-BC2O, pyridinic N, and pyrrolic N groups on the carbon matrix
   played the important roles in the BPA degradation. The outstanding
   catalytic performance of Fe@BPC-20BN could be attributed to the
   synergistic effects between iron nanoparticles and the B/N codoped
   carbon matrix. This study gives new insights into the design and
   preparation of high-efficient B,N-decorated carbocatalysts for

AB Background: Photocatalytic degradation of pollutants has the
   characteristics of high energy efficiency and no secondary pollution. In
   this paper, organic-inorganic perylene diimide modified BiO2-x
   (PDI/BiO2-x) was synthesized, which can degrade various kinds of
   pollutants efficiently.
   Method: The samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, DRS, PL and
   ESR.
   Results: It was found that the introduction of PDI sA effectively
   improved the separation efficiency and increased surface area of BiO2-x.
   When PD/BiO2-x catalyst was used to degrade RhB and MB, the degradation
   rates were increased by 21 and 18 times respectively. In addition, it
   could also degrade methyl orange and tetracycline hydrochloride. At the
   same time, the degradation rate still maintained 85% through five times
   recycle experiments. (C) 2021 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB Sustainable and cheaper intercession coupled with green technologies
   could be the feasible and finest approach for addressing the solicitous
   snags like energy crises, greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel
   depletions globally. Biodiesel appeared as a feasible substitute to
   achieve net zero emissions globally. Biodiesel produced from waste,
   toxic and non-edible oil seeds is clean, cheaper and capable for
   producing greener energy which ultimately contributed positively in
   boosting bio-economy (close circular economy). In the present study, the
   potential of Carthamus lanatus L. seed oil (CSO) as novel, non-edible
   and waste feedstock was investigated for producing biodiesel using
   cobalt tungstate loaded reduced graphene oxide (CoWO3@rGO) as novel,
   green and recyclable catalysts. The catalyst (CoWO3@rGO) was synthesized
   via Hummers method followed by characterizations by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX).
   Optimize biodiesel yield (99.7 wt%) was achieved with optimum re-action
   conditions of 0.8 wt% catalyst, oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:12 and
   temperature 65 degrees C for 2 h reaction time. The optimized Carthamus
   lanatus L. biodiesel (CBD) yield was also predicted by drawing 3D
   surface plots with response surface methodology (Box-Behnken design).
   The synthesized CBD was also characterized using latest techniques of
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (1H and 13C), Gas Chromatography/Mass
   spectroscopy (GC-MS) and FT-IR. The green nanocomposite exhibits
   excellent reusability of seven times without significant drop in its
   reactivity during transesterification process. Fuel properties of fatty
   acid methyl ester complied with biodiesel international standards EN
   14214, China GB/T 20828-2007 and ASTM D 6751. Ultimately, biodiesel
   produced from wild, uncultivated and non-edible CSO can be commendably
   used to engender and adopt a greener and sustainable energy approach.
   The acceptance and adoption of the green energy approach could bring
   positive outcomes in the environment which ultimately create healthier
   societal and economic development.

AB With the acceleration of deep oil and gas development, the problem of
   high temperature and high salinity in the formation is prominent, which
   seriously affects the rheology and filtration performance of water-based
   drilling fluid and causes drilling accidents such as formation collapse
   and wellbore instability. Therefore, in this work, a novel thickening
   and fluid loss control additive (i.e., ASML) with significant
   hydrophobic association characteristics as well as outstanding
   temperature- and salt-resistance was synthesized using acrylamide,
   sodium pstyrenesulfonate, maleic anhydride and lauryl methacrylate as
   monomers. The experiments of fluorescence spectroscopy, SEM, Zeta
   potential, rheology and filtration show that ASML makes the drilling
   fluid have more networked structure under the conditions of high
   temperature and high salt through hydrophobic association. At the same
   time, it also brings more negative charge to the bentonite by adsorbing
   ASML on the surface of bentonite, which effectively maintains its
   uniform colloidal dispersion, leading to higher viscosity, denser mud
   cake, and lower fluid loss under high temperature and high salinity
   conditions. Under the condition of 200 degrees C and 30 wt% NaCl, the
   fluid loss of ASML-based drilling fluid is only 5 ml, which is 94.3%
   lower than that of carboxymethyl cellulose-based drilling fluid. This
   study provides a new strategy for the development of temperature- and
   salt-resistant drilling fluid treatment agent, which is important for
   accelerating the efficient development of deep oil and gas.

AB High adsorption efficiency, active to both anionic and cationic dyes and
   simple desorption are three main challenges of the existed adsorbents
   for decolorization of the dye-contained wastewaters. Porous foams based
   on L-lysine (Lys) molecular-grafted cellulose were firstly designed and
   fabricated to overcome those challenges. Cellulose were grafted with Lys
   in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) via a chemical
   connection resulted from glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). The synthesized
   cellulose derivative (Cell-g-PGMA-Lys) was regenerated in the morphology
   of foam by non-solvent induced phase inversion from the BMIMCl-based
   solutions. The presence of Lys moieties and porous structure of
   Cell-g-PGMA-Lys were confirmed with a series of instrumental analysis.
   Both anionic reactive brilliant red X-3B (RBR X-3B) and cationic
   methylene blue (MB) were effectively adsorbed on and desorbed from
   Cell-g-PGMA-Lys by adjusting the solution pH value. Cell-g-PGMA-Lys had
   higher adsorption capacities than most of the reported adsorbents and
   was easy to separate from the decolorized water. It could be reused many
   times with little reduction of the adsorption capacity, which remained
   86.9% and 92.5% for RBR X-3B and MB respectively after six
   adsorption-desorption cycles. The isothermal and kinetic adsorption
   proved that dyes were adsorbed single-layered on Cell-g-PGMA-Lys
   depending upon the electrostatic interaction between adsorbent and
   adsorbate.

AB The collidal bimentalic nanoparticles of ZnO-Ag were prepared by laser

   characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, Scanning Electron Microscopy
   (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), Raman spectroscopy,
   X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Photo-Luminescence (PL).
   These techniques confirmed the formation of the bimetalic nanocompiste
   and showed that the size distribution of the synthesized bimetallic
   nanoparticles varied from 30 to 130 nm. The anticancer activity was
   validated by measuring the cell cytotocicty by MTT (3-(4,
   5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) test applying
   HCT-116 and HELA cancer cell line. The cell lines' sensitivity was the
   highest at 10 mg/mL of ZnO-Ag composite. This indicates that the

AB The effects of low-frequency and high-intensity ultrasonic treatments
   and curdlan gels on the thermal gelling and structural properties of soy
   protein isolate (SPI) were investigated. Low-frequency (20 kHz),
   high-intensity ultrasonic treatment improved the solubility and
   rheological properties of the SPI and promoted gelling, especially with
   400 W treatment for 10 min. The addition of thermo-reversible curdlan
   gel (TRC) or thermo-irreversible curdlan gel (TIRC) further improved gel
   strength and reduced cooking loss from SPI gels pretreated with
   ultrasound. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the SPI
   composite gel showed that the peak at 3268 cm(-1) for the O-H vibration
   exhibited a blue shift compared to the control SPI and a red shift
   compared to pure TRC or TIRC, which indicated formation of hydrogen
   bonding interactions between SPI and TRC or TIRC. Circular dichroism
   spectroscopy (CD) showed that the addition of TRC or TIRC significantly
   decreased the a-helix content but increased the p-sheet contents of SPI
   gels due to denaturation and unfolding of SPI. Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) showed that the addition of TRC or TIRC led SPI gel to
   form a more regular and homogeneous network. These results revealed that
   the ultrasonic treatment and curdlan gels had obvious synergistic
   effects that improved the quality of SPI gels. Moreover, compared with
   TIRC, TRC addition promoted expansion and interactions of SPI molecules
   and formed a more stable network. Therefore, ultrasonic treatment
   combined with curdlan addition significantly improved the thermal
   gelation and structural properties of SPI.

AB The production and consumption of products are held responsible for most
   environmental challenges and climatic changes, which adversely affect
   human lives and compromise the future of generations to come.
   Sustainable production appears as a strategic route to combat these
   adversities, the pursuit of which is highly challenging. In this study,
   we argue that Intellectual capital (IC), featured by human capital,
   relational capital, and structural capital, can play a dual role in
   improving the sustainable production of a firm. We put forward that IC
   contributes to sustainable production directly and indirectly through
   the adoption of blockchain-driven supply chain management (BCSCM). In
   this context, the objective of this study is to examine the impact of
   intellectual capital (IC) on sustainable production. The study also
   investigates the role of SC mapping and BCSCM in the association between
   IC and sustainable production. Data were collected from 289 textile
   firms of Pakistan and Bangladesh with the help of a designed
   questionnaire. The study employed CB-SEM to examine the modeled
   relationship. Further, PLS-Multi-group Analysis (MGA) was used for
   cross-country comparison of the results. The results diverge from the
   conventional wisdom exhibiting an insignificant direct impact of IC in
   sustainable production. Nevertheless, the results show a meaningful
   indirect effect of IC through BCSCM and SC mapping on sustainable
   production. Results also exhibit a significant direct impact of BCSCM on
   the sustainable production of a firm. The results call for consideration
   of IC and BCSCM in improving the sustainability of a firm.

AB Herein, mesoporous activated carbon (AC) was prepared through potassium
   hydroxide (KOH) activation of hydrochar derived from the hydrothermal
   carbonization (HTC) of chickpea stem (CS), and successfully applied to
   remove methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions in a batch system.
   The HTC-CSAC was prepared depending on different impregnation ratios
   (hydrochar:KOH, 50-150%), impregnation times (12-48h), activation
   temperatures (400-600 degrees C) and activation times (30-60min). To
   define HTC-CSAC, various analytical techniques such as iodine adsorption
   number (IAN), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) were used.
   In the removal process of MB by the best HTC-CSAC with a high IAN of
   887mg g(-1) obtained under conditions including impregnation ratio of
   70%, activation time of 45min, activation temperature of 600 degrees C
   and impregnation time of 24h, the effects of adsorption parameters such
   as pH factor (2-10), adsorbent dosage (50-100mg), initial MB
   concentration (40-80mg/L) and contact time (90-180min) were studied.
   Besides, a detailed evaluation of the adsorption mechanism for the
   removal of MB by HTC-CSAC was performed. The Langmuir model indicated
   the best isotherm data correlation, with a maximum monolayer adsorption
   capacity (Q(max)) of 96.15mg g(-1). The adsorption isotherm findings
   demonstrated that the MB removal process is feasible, and that this
   process takes place through the physical interaction mechanism.
   Additionally, the HTC-CSAC adsorbent exhibited a high regeneration and
   reuse performance in MB removal. After five consecutive
   adsorption-desorption cycles, HTC-CSAC maintained the reuse efficiency
   of 77.86%. As a result, the prepared HTC-CSAC with a high BET surface
   area of 455m(2) g(-1) and an average pore diameter of 105 angstrom could
   be recommended as a promising and reusable adsorbent in the treatment of
   synthetic dyes in wastewaters.

   spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), mechanical
   compression and rheometry. Results showed that the pore structure,

   varying lignin content and crosslinker ratio. By increasing the
   crosslinker N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N '-ethylcarbodiimide
   hydrochloride (EDC) content, the pore size became smaller, while
   increasing the lignin content resulted in larger pores. In addition, all
   hydrogels show strong shear thinning behavior. Ribavirin was used as a
   drug model, and its release rate was enhanced by increasing lignin
   content in the binary hydrogel structure. A higher Ribavirin cumulative
   release was observed for gelatin/lignin with higher lignin content (3 %)
   hydrogel. These findings emphasize the chemical composition on the
   structure and the release behavior of lignin-containing hydrogels.

AB Probiotics have many beneficial physiological effects, such as enhancing
   immunity and regulating intestinal microflora. However, the highly
   acidic conditions in the stomach and the high bile acid concentration in
   the small intestine pose challenges to the maintenance of probiotic
   activity after ingestion. In this study, we examined the possibility of
   increasing the viability of probiotics under gastrointestinal conditions
   by encapsulating them within oil-in-water high internal phase emulsions
   (HIPEs). These emulsions were prepared using whey protein isolate (WPI)
   and pectin, which were gelled by adding GDL and calcium to form double
   network HIPE gels. The gel strength, stability, and shear viscosity of
   the gelled HIPEs increased as the pectin concentration was raised from 0
   to 2%. Cryo-SEM analysis showed that the pectin formed a dense hydrogel
   network in the aqueous phase surrounding the oil droplets in the HIPEs.
   Probiotics were encapsulated within the gelled HIPEs by dispersing a
   probiotic powder in the oil phase. Confocal microscopy indicated that
   the probiotics were mostly distributed in the water, and interfacial
   phases, with only a few of the probiotics remaining in the oil phase.
   Encapsulation of the probiotics in the HIPEs increased the number of
   live cells remaining after a heat treatment and after passage through a
   simulated gastrointestinal model. The incorporation of pectin into the
   HIPEs increased the viability of the probiotics, especially after
   exposure to the gastric phase. This study highlights the potential of
   HIPEs in preserving probiotic activity, which may be useful for the
   development of more effective functional foods.

AB This study aimed to develop a chitosan/zein based bilayer film loaded
   with nanoparticles (0, 1, 2, and 3%) as a reinforcing and functional
   agent and to investigate the effects of NPs on the physicochemical
   properties and structural attributes of the film. Curcumin-loaded
   pectin-based nanoparticles (NPs) with antimicrobial nisin were prepared
   using a combina-tion of anti-solvent precipitation and complexation, and
   embedding NPs into the chitosan matrix to improve the physicochemical
   and functional properties of the chitosan/zein bilayer films. The
   average particle size and zeta-potential of the NPs were 143 nm and-33.0
   mV, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the NPs had good compatibility
   with the film matrix and filled void spaces in the film matrix, which
   significantly improved the mechanical properties of the bilayer films
   (elongation at break increased from 63.2 to 86.8%; tensile strength
   increased from 32.4 to 45.1 MPa). The NPs bilayer films had higher
   barrier properties and thermal stability as well as UV blocking
   properties compared to bilayer films without NPs, while the controlled
   release of the active agents was sustainable. Likewise, the
   antimicrobial activity against the food-borne pathogens Staphylococcus
   aureus and Escherichia coli and the antioxidant activity of the NPs
   bilayer films depended on the NPs loading. The results suggested new
   design principles for chitosan/zein bilayer biofilms for potential use
   with sustainable food packaging, where the properties of the bilayer
   films could be tailored by controlling the concentration of NPs.

AB Mobile-learning (M-learning) apps have grown in popularity and demand in
   recent years and have become a typical occurrence in modern educational
   systems, particularly with the deployment of M-learning initiatives. The
   key objective of this study was to reveal the key factors that impact
   university students' behavioural intention and actual use of mobile
   learning in their education. The technology acceptance model (TAM) is
   used in this study to investigate the impacts of several factors found
   in the literature on students' adoption of M-learning systems in higher
   education. The data was gathered from 176 university students who
   completed a paper questionnaire. The data was analyzed using the SEM
   technique. The findings revealed that perceived mobile value (PMV),
   academic relevance (AR), and self-management of M-learning (SML) are the
   primary drivers of students' acceptance of M-learning and, as a result,
   the success of M-learning projects' implementation. The findings of this
   study give crucial information on how higher education institutions may
   improve students' acceptance of M-learning in order to promote students'
   attitudes toward M-learning (ATT) it and their behavioural intentions
   (BIM) to use it in the teaching and learning process. These findings
   have significant implications for the acceptance and use of M-learning.

AB In underground engineering constructions, fractured rock masses are
   likely to be subjected to three-dimensional static stress and dynamic
   loading simultaneously. In this study, via a modified split Hopkinson
   pressure bar (SHPB) system, a series of triaxial dynamic tests are
   carried on sandstone containing a pre-existing flaw under different
   radial confining pressures ranging from 5.7 to 22.7 MPa and different
   strain rates varying by 85-252 s(-1). The results indicate that both the
   dynamic strength and energy dissipation density of single-flawed
   sandstone feature a positive correlation with the rising radial
   confining pressure and strain rate; while the dynamic elastic modulus,
   failure strain and energy utilization efficiency all exhibit an evident
   radial confining pressure enhancement effect, these are insensitive to
   the strain rate. Moreover, the fragment distributions of single-flawed
   sandstone are adequately characterized by combining sieving tests and
   generalized extreme value function. Under a higher strain rate, the
   single-flawed specimen is featured by smaller average fragment size and
   wider fragment distribution range, while the higher confining pressure
   has the opposite effect. By post-mortem examination, three main failure
   types are classified, and the fracturing mechanism of new cracks is
   revealed by microscopic observation using a scanning electron microscope
   (SEM). The macro oblique shear crack and through shear crack are mainly
   induced by the shear slip mechanism, while the quasi-coplanar crack is
   tensile dominated.

   mechanical, hydrophobic properties and antioxidant activity of composite
   films. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate the interactions and
   compatibility of PP, CNP-PP, and the film substrates. Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the microstructures of the films.
   The release of PP in 10% and 50% (v/v) ethanol simulants was also
   examined. The results indicated that the incorporation of PP or CNP-PP
   into the starch film (5) increased their opacity and also improved their
   hydrophobicity. XRD and SEM revealed that the elongation at break
   increased significantly (p < 0.05), while the tensile strength decreased
   with the addition of CNP-PP, which were attributed to the reduced
   crystallinity and agglomerates distributed onto the film surface,
   respectively. Release studies revealed that the S + CNP-PP film
   exhibited an extended-release behavior of the encapsulated PP for 1440
   min, compared to the burst release in the S + PP film, and the release
   kinetics was well fitted by the Fick's diffusion model. Moreover, the S
   + CNP-PP film showed excellent antioxidant activity and could inhibit
   the oxidation of cheese. Therefore, the extended-release antioxidant
   film has potential applications in food packaging for extending food
   shelf-life.

AB shrimp protein functionality during chilling storage recently attention
   due to its adverse effects on shrimp quality. The high-intensity
   ultrasound (20 kHz, 400 W) was applied to improve the protein structure
   and functional properties of frozen shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in
   this study. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that
   the cavitation effect of ultrasound could change the secondary structure
   of myofibrillar protein (MP) by turning the alpha-helix and random coil
   to beta-sheet and beta-turn. The unfolding of MP conformation increased
   the reactive sulfhydryl content and surface hydrophobicity accordingly.
   The structure changes eventually led to the significant improvement of
   protein functionality. Gel properties analysis showed after ultrasonic
   treatment, the gel strength and water holding capacity of protein gels
   were increased gradually. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images also
   demonstrated that ultrasound treatment contributed to the formation of
   stable network structures in protein gels. In addition, ultrasonic
   ho-mogenization could increase the emulsifying ability (45.54 m2/g to
   78.82 m2/g) and stability of protein in a short time, which might be
   related to the decrease of particle size. Confocal laser scanning
   microscope (CLSM) analysis further illustrated that ultrasound treatment
   made the emulsion distribution more uniform. The appli-cation of these
   findings will improve the deep processing ability and expand the
   commercialization of frozen shrimp products.

AB Chitosan (CS) films have demonstrated strong antibacterial properties,
   excellent biocompatibility and biode-gradability, but poor UV blocking,
   oxygen and water barrier and mechanical properties limit their
   application in antimicrobial food packaging. In this study, CS films
   were incorporated with nanofillers, including lignin nanoparticles (LNP,
   1-5 wt %) and acylated soy protein isolate nanogel (ASPNG, 3-7 wt %) to
   improve their tensile strength, oxygen and water barrier, UV blocking
   and antibacterial properties. SEM images illustrated that the addition
   of LNP and ASPNG significantly affected the surface morphology of the CS
   film. Meanwhile, LNP incorporation improved UV blocking property of
   composite film, while an improved sustained antibacterial property was
   achieved with ASPNG incorporation. Interestingly, CS composite film
   incorporated with 3% LNP and 5% ASPNG showed a remarkable increase in
   tensile strength (37.29-54.29 MPa) and decreased oxygen barrier property
   (5.73-2.83 cm3/m2.24 h MPa) relative to pure CS film. It is worth
   mentioning that the bacterial counts in samples treated by 3% LNP/5%
   ASPNG-CS composite film decreased approximately 2.37 log CFU/mL, which
   exhibited higher antibacterial activity than other composite films.
   However, this study also demonstrated that incorporation of LNP and
   ASPNG slightly decreased the light transmission and increased surface
   roughness of CS film. All in all, the CS composite film with enhanced
   mechanical, barriers, antibacterial properties were obtained by
   incorporating an appropriate proportion of LNP and ASPNG and could
   further be utilized as a promising antibacterial food packaging
   material.

AB Smart Farming Technologies (SFT) are smart devices part of a
   cyber-physical system able to improve farm management. Compared to other
   digital technologies' functionalities, SFT generate a multitude of data
   that once combined can be used not only on-farm but across the entire
   supply chain. Although recent studies highlighted how the lack of users'
   resources and competences might hinder the diffusion of digital
   agriculture technologies overall, few studies so far focused
   specifically on SFT. Moreover, the extant literature interprets the
   adoption decision mostly as "one-off binary" process, and limited
   attention is given to individual aspects of users and farms. Therefore,
   this study investigates the adoption of SFT analyzing various aspects of
   its complex nature; on the one hand, the analysis considers the
   multi-step nature of the adoption decision process: first, intention
   formation and then, actual adoption decision. On the other hand, the SFT
   adoption process is interpreted as being determined by several
   typologies of determinants beyond the most studied ones, with a
   particular focus on the role that organizational conditions and the
   supply chain governance structure play in influencing farmers' adoption
   of SFT.
   An empirical analysis is run on a sample of 474 responses, collected
   through an on-line survey. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and a
   Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression (ZIP) were used to investigate
   respectively the intention to use and the actual adoption of SFT.
   Results show that farmers' intention to use mainly relies on
   technologies' performance expectancy, technologies' complexity and
   social influence exerted on farmers, while organizational supporting
   conditions do not play a significant effect. Nonetheless, when the
   actual adoption decision is observed, the likelihood that non-adopters
   intend to adopt SFT in their farms increases when formal integration
   along the supply chain is high and with the dimension of the farm (in
   terms of both land size and sales). When the adopters are analyzed
   instead, the decision to adopt is positively affected only by the
   individual intention to use and by farmers' specialization in the arable
   sector.
   Findings reveal what factors need to be considered to guarantee a fairer
   and more inclusive agricultural digitalization, such as the role of
   social influence exerted by some figures around farmers and the still
   weak facilitating organizational conditions.

AB Noni (Morinda citrifolia) fruit is a natural food source rich in
   antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds. In this study, the
   phytochemicals of noni fruit extract (NFE) were identified by using
   HPLC-ESI-qTOF/MS method. Subsequently, casting method was adopted to
   prepare pectin and/or chitosan (CH)-based films incorporated with NFE.
   The influence of NFE addition on the physicochemical, microstructure,
   and biological properties of pectin and/or CH-based films was evaluated.
   Results confirmed that incorporation of NFE into pectin and/or CH-based
   films increased the tensile properties, water vapor permeability (WVP)
   and opacity of the films, but declined the thickness, moisture content
   and water solubility slightly. However, pectin-based films showed higher
   water solubility than CH-based films followed by pectin/CH-based films.
   In addition, the addition of NFE slightly decreased the film's thermal
   stability, and CH-based films showed better thermal stability compared
   to pectin or pectin/CH-based films. Regardless of the NFE addition, no
   significant morphological changes of pectin and pectin/CH-based films
   were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Compared with
   the control films, the average roughness of CH-based film surface was
   evidently increased. FTIR results showed that the addition of NFE had no
   remarkably influences on chemical structures of the films. More
   importantly, the addition of NFE effectively improved the antioxidant
   and antibacterial activities of the pectin and/or CH-based films, which
   was due to phenolic compounds existed in NFE. In short, pectin and/or
   CH-based films incorporated with NFE is characterized with
   eco-friendliness, reliability and multiplex bio-activities, which is
   expected to be a promising alternative for the plastics food packaging
   film.

AB This study investigates consumer purchase intention of green cosmetics
   and personal care products in Thailand by extending the Perceived Value
   Theory with ethical concern as a green consumption determinant to
   determine their interrelationships. The results from PLS-SEM from the
   responses of 423 consumers show that the perceived functional value
   significantly impacts ethical concern and consumer purchase intention.
   The perceived emotional value is also positively correlated with ethical
   concern but showed no correlation with consumer purchase inten-tion.
   However, the influence of the perceived social value on ethical concern
   and purchase intention was not sup-ported. Meanwhile, the ethical
   concern is a strong predictor of green purchase intention which mediates
   a positive relationship between functional value and intention, as well
   as between emotional value and intention. However, no mediation effect
   was found between ethical concern and social value. These findings offer
   contribu-tions toward extending the knowledge on how these
   multidimensional consumer values coincide and influence behavioral
   intention. This research makes a practical contribution to industry
   practitioners and policymakers to promote green product attributes by
   linking functional and emotional perceptions with ethical considerations
   such as fair trade, cruelty-free and green formulation, eco-labeling,
   and green packaging, which may in turn in-crease purchase intention
   toward green cosmetics and personal care products that could induce a

AB Due to the monsoon climate, saline soils extensively spread over the
   arid or semi-arid area (e.g. NW China) and are featured with notable
   dissolution collapsibility and salt expandability. The features cause
   road hump and subgrade corrosion towards endangering the safety of
   passers. In this study, the microstructural evolution of the loess when
   subjected to alkaline and saline environments was investigated using a
   series of microscale tests, including scanning electron microscopic
   (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (SEM-EDS), and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The correspondence
   of the microstructural evolution with the macroscale mechanical
   properties using the reduced triaxial extension tests was studied. The
   test results showed that the alkaline and saline environments led to the
   microstructural evolution of the loess, involving the particle
   morphology, microstructural characteristics, pore distribution, and
   directionality of the pores. The increasing thickness of the diffuse
   double layer, induced by sodium sulphate, reduced the suction and
   deteriorated the microstructural characteristics, causing a degradation
   of the macroscale mechanical properties. Under sodium hydroxide
   conditions, a distinct transformation from granular structures to an
   agglomerated structure was attributed to the formation of sodium
   silicate, and the surface-surface connections were formed at the same
   time, which also indicated an enhancement of the microstructural
   characteristics. The enhanced microstructural characteristics
   contributed to the improvement in the macroscale mechanical properties.
   The findings of this study provide some design guideposts for preventing
   and mitigating the degradation of subgrade when exposed to saline
   environments.

AB Microplastics (<5 mm) are a pollutant of growing ecotoxicological
   concern for marine and human health. This critical review aims (i) to
   systematically evaluate the findings on microplastics sources,
   occurrence, and spatial distribution in marine sediments, (ii) to
   examine the characteristics of keywords, authors, co-authors, country,
   bibliographical analysis, and publication results using VOSviewer. We
   identified around 350 papers from the Web of Science regarding
   microplastic pollution published between 2010 and 2020. Original
   research articles (95.62%) in high quality journals such as Marine
   Pollution Bulletin (54.79%), Environmental Pollution (15.07%), Science
   of the Total Environment (7.40%), Environmental Science and Technology
   (4.93%), Marine Environmental Research (4.66%), Environmental Science
   Pollution Research (2.7%), Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science (2.19%),
   Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology (1.65%),
   Environmental Monitoring and Assessment (1.37%), and Environment
   International (0.82%) were chosen. Different types of polymers are found
   in the environment, the most common being polyethylene (PE),
   polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). Possible sources, abundances,
   composition, and size of microplastics in marine sediments, as well as
   keywords (1000), authors, and co-authors (1445), are discussed. For the
   identification of microplastics in marine sediments, most researchers
   used Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR) (74%), Raman
   Spectroscopy (14%), and Scanning Electron Microscopy -Energy Dispersive
   Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) (12%). The current review offers an extensive
   range of detailed information to help the scientific community
   understand the problems and devise control measures to minimize both
   plastic consumption and the resulting risks to the marine ecosystem.

AB The study purports to empirically draw out the prominence of
   eco-innovation in achieving sustainability in business performances,
   which is further tested by the moderation of turbulent market conditions
   on the relationship. In contrast to previous eco-innovation research, a
   nascent methodology involving a dual-stage hybrid analysis and an
   emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, deep learning was used
   to analyze 683 viable responses from Ghanaian manufacturing firms.Some
   intriguing conclusions were discovered where the dimensions of
   sustainable business performance are achievable vis-`a-vis the
   implementation of product, process, and organizational eco-innovation.
   Notably, a manufacturing firm's environmental performance can be
   considerably improved by implementing the triumvirate of product,
   process, and organizational eco-innovation. Subsequently, a firm can
   improve its social performance by R&D investment in eco-innovations,
   novel green management practices and staff sensitization on
   eco-innovation. Lastly, market turbulence (technology and environmental
   turbulence) in the form of technological advancements, intense market
   competition, changing household demand and taste amplifies the positive
   effect of product and organizational eco-innovation on the economic
   dimension of sustainable performance.Theoretically, a newly integrated
   theoretical framework, which incorporates eco-innovation, contingency
   and RBV theory, could aid in determining the relative importance of
   specific determinants, thereby providing significant contributions to
   eco-innovations effect on the sustainability of business performance.

AB In this study, nano-sized beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-metal-organic
   frameworks (MOFs) loaded with catechin (CAT) were successfully
   synthesized, zein films incorporated with different amounts of
   CAT-beta-CD-MOFs (0-8 wt% on zein basis) were developed, and the
   structure, physicochemical, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of
   the films were determined. FT-IR revealed that the CAT-beta-CD-MOFs
   could interact with zein through intermolecular hydrogen bonds. XRD
   results confirmed the appearance of crystalline peaks due to the
   presence of CAT-beta-CD-MOFs inside the films. SEM showed that the
   addition of CAT-beta-CD-MOFs made microstructure of zein film more
   smooth and compact. The addition of CAT loaded beta-CD-MOFs into zein
   film significantly decreased the water vapor permeability and swelling
   degree (p < 0.05). CAT-beta-CD-MOFs addition significantly increased
   tensile strength and elongation at break from 2.53 to 19.24 MPa and
   1.65-5.65% (p < 0.05). Moreover, CAT-beta-CD-MOFs significantly improved
   the antioxidant activity of the composite film and the inhibitory
   activity against tested microorganisms (Escherichia coli and
   Staphylococcus aureus). CAT has sustained release properties in the
   composite film. Therefore, it is suggested that zein/CAT-beta-CD-MOFs
   films could offer great potential as active packaging to maintain the
   food quality.

AB Using solid wastes (SWs) as backfilling material to fill underground
   mined-out areas (UMOAs) solved the environmental problems caused by SWs
   and reduced the backfilling cost. In this study, fly ash (FA), gypsum
   and steel slag (SS) were used to prepare cement-based composites (CBC).
   The uniaxial compression, computed tomography (CT) and scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) laboratory experiments were conducted to explore the
   macro and micromechanical properties of CBC. The findings showed that
   the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of CBC with a curing time of 7 d
   could reach 6.54 MPa. The increase of SS content reduced the UCS of CBC,
   while the gypsum and FA content could increase the UCS of CBC.
   Microscopic studies have shown that the SS particles in CBC have
   noticeable sedimentation, and the increase of SS content causes the
   failure mode of CBC from tensile to tensile-shear. These research
   results can provide a scientific reference for the preparation of
   backfilling materials.

AB Mechanical, barrier, and thermal properties of biodegradable films
   prepared using different gelatin/chitosan blends without and with betel
   leaf ethanolic extract (BLEE) at 1 and 2% were investigated.
   Incorporation of BLEE enhanced elasticity and heat-seal ability of the
   films. However, the seal ability was diminished with increasing chitosan
   proportion (p < 0.05). Ultraviolet and visible light barrier abilities
   along with water vapor permeability were improved (p < 0.05) for films
   containing 2% BLEE. Swelling and water solubility of the films were
   lessened with augmenting BLEE concentrations (p < 0.05). Antioxidant and
   antibacterial activities were upsurged as BLEE levels incorporated
   increased. SEM images of selected films showed smooth homogenous surface
   and cross-section in film sample devoid of BLEE, while those
   incorporated with BLEE had slightly rough surface and cross-section.
   FT-IR spectra revealed differences in peaks and patterns between films
   without and with BLEE. Addition of BLEE enhanced thermal stability of
   film. Thus, gelatin/chitosan films containing BLEE could serve as active
   packaging with satisfactory properties.

AB In this work, the effect of in situ cross-linking of different cations
   on the properties of pectin-thymol active films was investigated.
   Specifically, pectin-thymol composite films (P-T) were developed by
   solution casting method, and then P-T/Ca, P-T/Fe, and P-T/Cu films with
   enhanced properties were developed by in situ cation cross linking in
   50% (v/v) ethanol-water solution containing Ca2+, Fe3+, and Cu2+,
   respectively. The thickness, color, optical properties, water
   sensitivity, water vapor permeability, mechanical properties,
   antimicrobial properties and thymol release properties of films were
   investigated. The interactions and specific micromorphology of films
   were also analyzed using FTIR and scanning electron microscope. The
   results showed that Fe3+ and Cu2+ could be uniformly distributed on the
   film surface and diffused into the interior by external in situ
   cross-linking. And the water resistance of the composite pectin films
   was significantly enhanced by the in situ cross-linking with different
   cations. The P-T/Fe films exhibited excellent UV-barrier properties. The
   mechanical properties and water vapor barrier properties of cation
   cross-linked P-T films were also improved. In addition, this work
   indicated that "egg-box " model formed between the cation and pectin
   molecule has a slow release effect on thymol in pectin films, which
   provides a new idea for the controlled release of active substances in
   pectin films.

AB In order to effectively manage transportation systems, and improve the
   attractiveness of public transport, public authorities, policymakers and
   researchers need a better understanding of the conditions necessary for
   improving attractiveness and those that can be considered sufficient.
   The purpose of this study is to expand the analytical toolbox of
   transportation research and introduce an analytical approach to
   identifying and distinguishing between the conditions that are necessary
   and sufficient for a desired outcome. Specifically, we suggest a
   complementary approach to combining partial least square structural
   equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and necessary condition analysis (NCA) in
   order to examine which service quality attributes (functionality,
   information, security/safety, comfort, and cost) are sufficient, and
   what degree of satisfaction with these attributes is necessary for high
   overall travel satisfaction. The data consists of subjectively reported
   experiences from over 900 users of public transportation in four
   northern European countries. We find that, for high overall travel
   satisfaction, a minimum level of satisfaction with comfort (equal to
   33.1%) is necessary. Furthermore, an increase in satisfaction with
   comfort, functionality/ reliability and cost is sufficient to improve
   overall travel satisfaction. This means that comfort is both a necessary
   and a sufficient condition, whereas functionality/reliability and cost
   are sufficient but non-necessary conditions in this context. We conclude
   that using this complementary approach can guide public transport
   managers and researchers in identifying important bottlenecks and
   establishing priorities for improving service quality, essential
   knowledge when developing effective strategies for attractive public
   transport services.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-based voice assistants have become an
   essential part of our daily lives. Yet, little is known concerning what
   motivates students to use them in educational activities. Therefore,
   this research develops a theoretical model by extending the technology
   acceptance model (TAM) with subjective norm, enjoyment, facilitating
   conditions, trust, and security to examine students' use of AI-based
   voice assistants for instructional purposes. The developed model was
   then validated based on data collected from 300 university students
   using the PLS-SEM technique. The results supported the role of
   enjoyment, trust, and perceived ease of use (PEOU) in affecting the
   perceived usefulness (PU) of voice assistants. The empirical results
   also showed that facilitating conditions and trust in technology
   strongly influence the PEOU. Contrary to the extant literature, the
   results indicated that subjective norm, facilitating conditions, and
   security did not impact PU. Similarly, subjective norm and enjoyment did
   not affect PEOU. This research is believed to add a holistic
   understanding of the key drivers affecting students' use of voice
   assistants for educational purposes. It offers several theoretical
   contributions and practical implications on how to successfully employ
   these assistants.

AB The implementation of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected
   most businesses worldwide. The transportation business, specifically in
   the Philippines, has been heavily affected since only the healthcare and
   essential workers were allowed to leave their homes during the early
   stage of the pandemic. This paper aimed to explore the service quality
   of Public Utility Vehicles (PUV) in the Philippines during the COVID-19
   pandemic utilizing the SERVQUAL dimensions. A total of 564 participants
   answered an online questionnaire using the convenience sampling
   approach, consisting of 58 questions. Structural equation modelling
   (SEM) was applied to derive the causal relationships between SERVQUAL
   dimensions, COVID-19 safety protocol, and customer satisfaction
   simultaneously. Out of the six dimensions, the SEM indicated that
   COVID-19 protocols, tangibility, and assurance variables were found to
   significantly affect PUV service quality and thus, customer
   satisfaction. This study is one of the first complete studies that
   analyzed the PUV service quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   findings could provide the government with an evaluation of the
   compliance of PUVs to the imposed COVID-19 protocols. Furthermore, the
   framework of this study could also be applied and extended in evaluating
